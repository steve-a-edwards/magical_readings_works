          The Tempest : Act 3 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Another part of the island.
  Direction: Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO
    STEPHANO
        1  Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink
        2  water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and
        3  board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.
    TRINCULO
        4  Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
        5  say there's but five upon this isle: we are three
        6  of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the
        7  state totters.
    STEPHANO
        8  Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
        9  are almost set in thy head.
    TRINCULO
       10  Where should they be set else? he were a brave
       11  monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
    STEPHANO
       12  My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
       13  for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I
       14  could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off
       15  and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
       16  monster, or my standard.
    TRINCULO
       17  Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
    STEPHANO
       18  We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
    TRINCULO
       19  Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say
       20  nothing neither.
    STEPHANO
       21  Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a
       22  good moon-calf.
    CALIBAN
       23  How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
       24  I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.
    TRINCULO
       25  Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to
       26  justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,
       27  was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
       28  sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,
       29  being but half a fish and half a monster?
    CALIBAN
       30  Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?
    TRINCULO
       31  'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!
    CALIBAN
       32  Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.
    STEPHANO
       33  Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
       34  prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's
       35  my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.
    CALIBAN
       36  I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
       37  hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
    STEPHANO
       38  Marry, will I kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
       39  and so shall Trinculo.
  Direction: Enter ARIEL, invisible
    CALIBAN
       40  As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a
       41  sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
    ARIEL
       42  Thou liest.
    CALIBAN
       43  Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my
       44  valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.
    STEPHANO
       45  Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by
       46  this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
    TRINCULO
       47  Why, I said nothing.
    STEPHANO
       48  Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
    CALIBAN
       49  I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
       50  From me he got it. if thy greatness will
       51  Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
       52  But this thing dare not,--
    STEPHANO
       53  That's most certain.
    CALIBAN
       54  Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.
    STEPHANO
       55  How now shall this be compassed?
       56  Canst thou bring me to the party?
    CALIBAN
       57  Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
       58  Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.
    ARIEL
       59  Thou liest; thou canst not.
    CALIBAN
       60  What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
       61  I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
       62  And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
       63  He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
       64  Where the quick freshes are.
    STEPHANO
       65  Trinculo, run into no further danger:
       66  interrupt the monster one word further, and,
       67  by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors
       68  and make a stock-fish of thee.
    TRINCULO
       69  Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
       70  off.
    STEPHANO
       71  Didst thou not say he lied?
    ARIEL
       72  Thou liest.
    STEPHANO
       73  Do I so? take thou that.
  Direction: Beats TRINCULO
       74  As you like this, give me the lie another time.
    TRINCULO
       75  I did not give the lie. Out o' your
       76  wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
       77  this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
       78  your monster, and the devil take your fingers!
    CALIBAN
       79  Ha, ha, ha!
    STEPHANO
       80  Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther
       81  off.
    CALIBAN
       82  Beat him enough: after a little time
       83  I'll beat him too.
    STEPHANO
       84  Stand farther. Come, proceed.
    CALIBAN
       85  Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
       86  I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
       87  Having first seized his books, or with a log
       88  Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
       89  Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
       90  First to possess his books; for without them
       91  He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
       92  One spirit to command: they all do hate him
       93  As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
       94  He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--
       95  Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal
       96  And that most deeply to consider is
       97  The beauty of his daughter; he himself
       98  Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
       99  But only Sycorax my dam and she;
      100  But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
      101  As great'st does least.
    STEPHANO
      102  Is it so brave a lass?
    CALIBAN
      103  Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
      104  And bring thee forth brave brood.
    STEPHANO
      105  Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I
      106  will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
      107  Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
      108  like the plot, Trinculo?
    TRINCULO
      109  Excellent.
    STEPHANO
      110  Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,
      111  while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
    CALIBAN
      112  Within this half hour will he be asleep:
      113  Wilt thou destroy him then?
    STEPHANO
      114  Ay, on mine honour.
    ARIEL
      115  This will I tell my master.
    CALIBAN
      116  Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
      117  Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
      118  You taught me but while-ere?
    STEPHANO
      119  At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
      120  reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
  Direction: Sings
      121  Flout 'em and scout 'em
      122  And scout 'em and flout 'em
      123  Thought is free.
    CALIBAN
      124  That's not the tune.
  Direction: Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe
    STEPHANO
      125  What is this same?
    TRINCULO
      126  This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
      127  of Nobody.
    STEPHANO
      128  If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:
      129  if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
    TRINCULO
      130  O, forgive me my sins!
    STEPHANO
      131  He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
    CALIBAN
      132  Art thou afeard?
    STEPHANO
      133  No, monster, not I.
    CALIBAN
      134  Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
      135  Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
      136  Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
      137  Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
      138  That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
      139  Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
      140  The clouds methought would open and show riches
      141  Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,
      142  I cried to dream again.
    STEPHANO
      143  This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall
      144  have my music for nothing.
    CALIBAN
      145  When Prospero is destroyed.
    STEPHANO
      146  That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
    TRINCULO
      147  The sound is going away; let's follow it, and
      148  after do our work.
    STEPHANO
      149  Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see
      150  this tabourer; he lays it on.
    TRINCULO
      151  Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.
  Direction: Exeunt
