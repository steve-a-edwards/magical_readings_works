          The Tempest : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
  Direction: Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA
    PROSPERO
        1  If I have too austerely punish'd you,
        2  Your compensation makes amends, for I
        3  Have given you here a third of mine own life,
        4  Or that for which I live; who once again
        5  I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
        6  Were but my trials of thy love and thou
        7  Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,
        8  I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
        9  Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
       10  For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
       11  And make it halt behind her.
    FERDINAND
       12  I do believe it
       13  Against an oracle.
    PROSPERO
       14  Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
       15  Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
       16  If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
       17  All sanctimonious ceremonies may
       18  With full and holy rite be minister'd,
       19  No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
       20  To make this contract grow: but barren hate,
       21  Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
       22  The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
       23  That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
       24  As Hymen's lamps shall light you.
    FERDINAND
       25  As I hope
       26  For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
       27  With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
       28  The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.
       29  Our worser genius can, shall never melt
       30  Mine honour into lust, to take away
       31  The edge of that day's celebration
       32  When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
       33  Or Night kept chain'd below.
    PROSPERO
       34  Fairly spoke.
       35  Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
       36  What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!
  Direction: Enter ARIEL
    ARIEL
       37  What would my potent master? here I am.
    PROSPERO
       38  Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
       39  Did worthily perform; and I must use you
       40  In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
       41  O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
       42  Incite them to quick motion; for I must
       43  Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
       44  Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
       45  And they expect it from me.
    ARIEL
       46  Presently?
    PROSPERO
       47  Ay, with a twink.
    ARIEL
       48  Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
       49  And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
       50  Each one, tripping on his toe,
       51  Will be here with mop and mow.
       52  Do you love me, master? no?
    PROSPERO
       53  Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
       54  Till thou dost hear me call.
    ARIEL
       55  Well, I conceive.
  Direction: Exit
    PROSPERO
       56  Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
       57  Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
       58  To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
       59  Or else, good night your vow!
    FERDINAND
       60  I warrant you sir;
       61  The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
       62  Abates the ardour of my liver.
    PROSPERO
       63  Well.
       64  Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,
       65  Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!
       66  No tongue! all eyes! be silent.
  Direction: Soft music
  Direction: Enter IRIS
    IRIS
       67  Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
       68  Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
       69  Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
       70  And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
       71  Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
       72  Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
       73  To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,
       74  Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
       75  Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;
       76  And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
       77  Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,
       78  Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
       79  Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
       80  Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
       81  To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
       82  Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
  Direction: Enter CERES
    CERES
       83  Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
       84  Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
       85  Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
       86  Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
       87  And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
       88  My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
       89  Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
       90  Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?
    IRIS
       91  A contract of true love to celebrate;
       92  And some donation freely to estate
       93  On the blest lovers.
    CERES
       94  Tell me, heavenly bow,
       95  If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
       96  Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
       97  The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
       98  Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
       99  I have forsworn.
    IRIS
      100  Of her society
      101  Be not afraid: I met her deity
      102  Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
      103  Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
      104  Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
      105  Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
      106  Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;
      107  Mars's hot minion is returned again;
      108  Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
      109  Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
      110  And be a boy right out.
    CERES
      111  High'st queen of state,
      112  Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
  Direction: Enter JUNO
    JUNO
      113  How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
      114  To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be
      115  And honour'd in their issue.
  Direction: They sing:
    JUNO
      116  Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
      117  Long continuance, and increasing,
      118  Hourly joys be still upon you!
      119  Juno sings her blessings upon you.
    CERES
      120  Earth's increase, foison plenty,
      121  Barns and garners never empty,
      122  Vines and clustering bunches growing,
      123  Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
      124  Spring come to you at the farthest
      125  In the very end of harvest!
      126  Scarcity and want shall shun you;
      127  Ceres' blessing so is on you.
    FERDINAND
      128  This is a most majestic vision, and
      129  Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold
      130  To think these spirits?
    PROSPERO
      131  Spirits, which by mine art
      132  I have from their confines call'd to enact
      133  My present fancies.
    FERDINAND
      134  Let me live here ever;
      135  So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
      136  Makes this place Paradise.
  Direction: Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment
    PROSPERO
      137  Sweet, now, silence!
      138  Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
      139  There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,
      140  Or else our spell is marr'd.
    IRIS
      141  You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,
      142  With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
      143  Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
      144  Answer your summons; Juno does command:
      145  Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
      146  A contract of true love; be not too late.
  Direction: Enter certain Nymphs
      147  You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
      148  Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
      149  Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
      150  And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
      151  In country footing.
  Direction: Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish
    PROSPERO
      152  [Aside] I had forgot that foul conspiracy
      153  Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
      154  Against my life: the minute of their plot
      155  Is almost come.
  Direction: To the Spirits
      156  Well done! avoid; no more!
    FERDINAND
      157  This is strange: your father's in some passion
      158  That works him strongly.
    MIRANDA
      159  Never till this day
      160  Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
    PROSPERO
      161  You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
      162  As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
      163  Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
      164  As I foretold you, were all spirits and
      165  Are melted into air, into thin air:
      166  And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
      167  The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
      168  The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
      169  Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
      170  And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
      171  Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
      172  As dreams are made on, and our little life
      173  Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
      174  Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:
      175  Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
      176  If you be pleased, retire into my cell
      177  And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
      178  To still my beating mind.
    FERDINAND and MIRANDA
      179  We wish your peace.
  Direction: Exeunt
    PROSPERO
      180  Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.
  Direction: Enter ARIEL
    ARIEL
      181  Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
    PROSPERO
      182  Spirit,
      183  We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
    ARIEL
      184  Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
      185  I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
      186  Lest I might anger thee.
    PROSPERO
      187  Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
    ARIEL
      188  I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
      189  So fun of valour that they smote the air
      190  For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
      191  For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
      192  Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
      193  At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd
      194  their ears,
      195  Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
      196  As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
      197  That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
      198  Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
      199  Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
      200  I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
      201  There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
      202  O'erstunk their feet.
    PROSPERO
      203  This was well done, my bird.
      204  Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
      205  The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
      206  For stale to catch these thieves.
    ARIEL
      207  I go, I go.
  Direction: Exit
    PROSPERO
      208  A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
      209  Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
      210  Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
      211  And as with age his body uglier grows,
      212  So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
      213  Even to roaring.
  Direction: Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, etc
      214  Come, hang them on this line.
  Direction: PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet
    CALIBAN
      215  Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
      216  Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
    STEPHANO
      217  Monster, your fairy, which you say is
      218  a harmless fairy, has done little better than
      219  played the Jack with us.
    TRINCULO
      220  Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at
      221  which my nose is in great indignation.
    STEPHANO
      222  So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take
      223  a displeasure against you, look you,--
    TRINCULO
      224  Thou wert but a lost monster.
    CALIBAN
      225  Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
      226  Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
      227  Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
      228  All's hush'd as midnight yet.
    TRINCULO
      229  Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--
    STEPHANO
      230  There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
      231  monster, but an infinite loss.
    TRINCULO
      232  That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
      233  harmless fairy, monster.
    STEPHANO
      234  I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears
      235  for my labour.
    CALIBAN
      236  Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
      237  This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
      238  Do that good mischief which may make this island
      239  Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
      240  For aye thy foot-licker.
    STEPHANO
      241  Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
    TRINCULO
      242  O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
      243  what a wardrobe here is for thee!
    CALIBAN
      244  Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
    TRINCULO
      245  O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.
      246  O king Stephano!
    STEPHANO
      247  Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have
      248  that gown.
    TRINCULO
      249  Thy grace shall have it.
    CALIBAN
      250  The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
      251  To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
      252  And do the murder first: if he awake,
      253  From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
      254  Make us strange stuff.
    STEPHANO
      255  Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,
      256  is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
      257  the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
      258  hair and prove a bald jerkin.
    TRINCULO
      259  Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.
    STEPHANO
      260  I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:
      261  wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
      262  country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
      263  pass of pate; there's another garment for't.
    TRINCULO
      264  Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and
      265  away with the rest.
    CALIBAN
      266  I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
      267  And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
      268  With foreheads villanous low.
    STEPHANO
      269  Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
      270  away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you
      271  out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.
    TRINCULO
      272  And this.
    STEPHANO
      273  Ay, and this.
  Direction: A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on
    PROSPERO
      274  Hey, Mountain, hey!
    ARIEL
      275  Silver I there it goes, Silver!
    PROSPERO
      276  Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
  Direction: CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven out
      277  Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
      278  With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
      279  With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
      280  Than pard or cat o' mountain.
    ARIEL
      281  Hark, they roar!
    PROSPERO
      282  Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
      283  Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
      284  Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
      285  Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
      286  Follow, and do me service.
  Direction: Exeunt
