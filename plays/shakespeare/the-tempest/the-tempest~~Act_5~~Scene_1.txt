          The Tempest : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
  Direction: Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL
    PROSPERO
        1  Now does my project gather to a head:
        2  My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
        3  Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
    ARIEL
        4  On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
        5  You said our work should cease.
    PROSPERO
        6  I did say so,
        7  When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
        8  How fares the king and's followers?
    ARIEL
        9  Confined together
       10  In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
       11  Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
       12  In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
       13  They cannot budge till your release. The king,
       14  His brother and yours, abide all three distracted
       15  And the remainder mourning over them,
       16  Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
       17  Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'
       18  His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
       19  From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
       20  That if you now beheld them, your affections
       21  Would become tender.
    PROSPERO
       22  Dost thou think so, spirit?
    ARIEL
       23  Mine would, sir, were I human.
    PROSPERO
       24  And mine shall.
       25  Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
       26  Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
       27  One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
       28  Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
       29  Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
       30  Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury
       31  Do I take part: the rarer action is
       32  In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
       33  The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
       34  Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:
       35  My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
       36  And they shall be themselves.
    ARIEL
       37  I'll fetch them, sir.
  Direction: Exit
    PROSPERO
       38  Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
       39  And ye that on the sands with printless foot
       40  Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
       41  When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
       42  By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
       43  Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
       44  Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
       45  To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
       46  Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
       47  The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
       48  And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
       49  Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
       50  Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
       51  With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
       52  Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
       53  The pine and cedar: graves at my command
       54  Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth
       55  By my so potent art. But this rough magic
       56  I here abjure, and, when I have required
       57  Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
       58  To work mine end upon their senses that
       59  This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
       60  Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
       61  And deeper than did ever plummet sound
       62  I'll drown my book.
  Direction: Solemn music
  Direction: Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:
       63  A solemn air and the best comforter
       64  To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
       65  Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
       66  For you are spell-stopp'd.
       67  Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
       68  Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
       69  Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
       70  And as the morning steals upon the night,
       71  Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
       72  Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
       73  Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
       74  My true preserver, and a loyal sir
       75  To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
       76  Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
       77  Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
       78  Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
       79  Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
       80  You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
       81  Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,
       82  Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
       83  Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
       84  Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
       85  Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
       86  Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
       87  That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
       88  That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,
       89  Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
       90  I will discase me, and myself present
       91  As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
       92  Thou shalt ere long be free.
  Direction: ARIEL sings and helps to attire him
       93  Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
       94  In a cowslip's bell I lie;
       95  There I couch when owls do cry.
       96  On the bat's back I do fly
       97  After summer merrily.
       98  Merrily, merrily shall I live now
       99  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
    PROSPERO
      100  Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:
      101  But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
      102  To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
      103  There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
      104  Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
      105  Being awake, enforce them to this place,
      106  And presently, I prithee.
    ARIEL
      107  I drink the air before me, and return
      108  Or ere your pulse twice beat.
  Direction: Exit
    GONZALO
      109  All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
      110  Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
      111  Out of this fearful country!
    PROSPERO
      112  Behold, sir king,
      113  The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
      114  For more assurance that a living prince
      115  Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
      116  And to thee and thy company I bid
      117  A hearty welcome.
    ALONSO
      118  Whether thou best he or no,
      119  Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
      120  As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
      121  Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
      122  The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
      123  I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
      124  An if this be at all, a most strange story.
      125  Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
      126  Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
      127  Be living and be here?
    PROSPERO
      128  First, noble friend,
      129  Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
      130  Be measured or confined.
    GONZALO
      131  Whether this be
      132  Or be not, I'll not swear.
    PROSPERO
      133  You do yet taste
      134  Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
      135  Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
  Direction: Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
      136  But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
      137  I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
      138  And justify you traitors: at this time
      139  I will tell no tales.
    SEBASTIAN
      140  [Aside] The devil speaks in him.
    PROSPERO
      141  No.
      142  For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
      143  Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
      144  Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
      145  My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
      146  Thou must restore.
    ALONSO
      147  If thou be'st Prospero,
      148  Give us particulars of thy preservation;
      149  How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
      150  Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
      151  How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
      152  My dear son Ferdinand.
    PROSPERO
      153  I am woe for't, sir.
    ALONSO
      154  Irreparable is the loss, and patience
      155  Says it is past her cure.
    PROSPERO
      156  I rather think
      157  You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
      158  For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
      159  And rest myself content.
    ALONSO
      160  You the like loss!
    PROSPERO
      161  As great to me as late; and, supportable
      162  To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
      163  Than you may call to comfort you, for I
      164  Have lost my daughter.
    ALONSO
      165  A daughter?
      166  O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
      167  The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
      168  Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
      169  Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
    PROSPERO
      170  In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
      171  At this encounter do so much admire
      172  That they devour their reason and scarce think
      173  Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
      174  Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
      175  Been justled from your senses, know for certain
      176  That I am Prospero and that very duke
      177  Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
      178  Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
      179  To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
      180  For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
      181  Not a relation for a breakfast nor
      182  Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
      183  This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
      184  And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
      185  My dukedom since you have given me again,
      186  I will requite you with as good a thing;
      187  At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
      188  As much as me my dukedom.
  Direction: Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess
    MIRANDA
      189  Sweet lord, you play me false.
    FERDINAND
      190  No, my dear'st love,
      191  I would not for the world.
    MIRANDA
      192  Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
      193  And I would call it, fair play.
    ALONSO
      194  If this prove
      195  A vision of the Island, one dear son
      196  Shall I twice lose.
    SEBASTIAN
      197  A most high miracle!
    FERDINAND
      198  Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
      199  I have cursed them without cause.
  Direction: Kneels
    ALONSO
      200  Now all the blessings
      201  Of a glad father compass thee about!
      202  Arise, and say how thou camest here.
    MIRANDA
      203  O, wonder!
      204  How many goodly creatures are there here!
      205  How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
      206  That has such people in't!
    PROSPERO
      207  'Tis new to thee.
    ALONSO
      208  What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
      209  Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
      210  Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
      211  And brought us thus together?
    FERDINAND
      212  Sir, she is mortal;
      213  But by immortal Providence she's mine:
      214  I chose her when I could not ask my father
      215  For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
      216  Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
      217  Of whom so often I have heard renown,
      218  But never saw before; of whom I have
      219  Received a second life; and second father
      220  This lady makes him to me.
    ALONSO
      221  I am hers:
      222  But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
      223  Must ask my child forgiveness!
    PROSPERO
      224  There, sir, stop:
      225  Let us not burthen our remembrance with
      226  A heaviness that's gone.
    GONZALO
      227  I have inly wept,
      228  Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
      229  And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
      230  For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
      231  Which brought us hither.
    ALONSO
      232  I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
    GONZALO
      233  Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
      234  Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
      235  Beyond a common joy, and set it down
      236  With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
      237  Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
      238  And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
      239  Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
      240  In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
      241  When no man was his own.
    ALONSO
      242  [To FERDINAND and MIRANDA] Give me your hands:
      243  Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
      244  That doth not wish you joy!
    GONZALO
      245  Be it so! Amen!
  Direction: Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following
      246  O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
      247  I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
      248  This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
      249  That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
      250  Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
    Boatswain
      251  The best news is, that we have safely found
      252  Our king and company; the next, our ship--
      253  Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
      254  Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
      255  We first put out to sea.
    ARIEL
      256  [Aside to PROSPERO] Sir, all this service
      257  Have I done since I went.
    PROSPERO
      258  [Aside to ARIEL] My tricksy spirit!
    ALONSO
      259  These are not natural events; they strengthen
      260  From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?
    Boatswain
      261  If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
      262  I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
      263  And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
      264  Where but even now with strange and several noises
      265  Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
      266  And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
      267  We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
      268  Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
      269  Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
      270  Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
      271  Even in a dream, were we divided from them
      272  And were brought moping hither.
    ARIEL
      273  [Aside to PROSPERO] Was't well done?
    PROSPERO
      274  [Aside to ARIEL] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.
    ALONSO
      275  This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
      276  And there is in this business more than nature
      277  Was ever conduct of: some oracle
      278  Must rectify our knowledge.
    PROSPERO
      279  Sir, my liege,
      280  Do not infest your mind with beating on
      281  The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
      282  Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
      283  Which to you shall seem probable, of every
      284  These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
      285  And think of each thing well.
  Direction: Aside to ARIEL
      286  Come hither, spirit:
      287  Set Caliban and his companions free;
      288  Untie the spell.
  Direction: Exit ARIEL
      289  How fares my gracious sir?
      290  There are yet missing of your company
      291  Some few odd lads that you remember not.
  Direction: Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel
    STEPHANO
      292  Every man shift for all the rest, and
      293  let no man take care for himself; for all is
      294  but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!
    TRINCULO
      295  If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
      296  here's a goodly sight.
    CALIBAN
      297  O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
      298  How fine my master is! I am afraid
      299  He will chastise me.
    SEBASTIAN
      300  Ha, ha!
      301  What things are these, my lord Antonio?
      302  Will money buy 'em?
    ANTONIO
      303  Very like; one of them
      304  Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.
    PROSPERO
      305  Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
      306  Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
      307  His mother was a witch, and one so strong
      308  That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
      309  And deal in her command without her power.
      310  These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--
      311  For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
      312  To take my life. Two of these fellows you
      313  Must know and own; this thing of darkness!
      314  Acknowledge mine.
    CALIBAN
      315  I shall be pinch'd to death.
    ALONSO
      316  Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
    SEBASTIAN
      317  He is drunk now: where had he wine?
    ALONSO
      318  And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
      319  Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
      320  How camest thou in this pickle?
    TRINCULO
      321  I have been in such a pickle since I
      322  saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of
      323  my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.
    SEBASTIAN
      324  Why, how now, Stephano!
    STEPHANO
      325  O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
    PROSPERO
      326  You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?
    STEPHANO
      327  I should have been a sore one then.
    ALONSO
      328  This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
  Direction: Pointing to Caliban
    PROSPERO
      329  He is as disproportion'd in his manners
      330  As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
      331  Take with you your companions; as you look
      332  To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
    CALIBAN
      333  Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
      334  And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
      335  Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
      336  And worship this dull fool!
    PROSPERO
      337  Go to; away!
    ALONSO
      338  Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
    SEBASTIAN
      339  Or stole it, rather.
  Direction: Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO
    PROSPERO
      340  Sir, I invite your highness and your train
      341  To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
      342  For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
      343  With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
      344  Go quick away; the story of my life
      345  And the particular accidents gone by
      346  Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
      347  I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
      348  Where I have hope to see the nuptial
      349  Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
      350  And thence retire me to my Milan, where
      351  Every third thought shall be my grave.
    ALONSO
      352  I long
      353  To hear the story of your life, which must
      354  Take the ear strangely.
    PROSPERO
      355  I'll deliver all;
      356  And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
      357  And sail so expeditious that shall catch
      358  Your royal fleet far off.
  Direction: Aside to ARIEL
      359  My Ariel, chick,
      360  That is thy charge: then to the elements
      361  Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.
  Direction: Exeunt
      362  EPILOGUE
      363  SPOKEN BY PROSPERO
      364  Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
      365  And what strength I have's mine own,
      366  Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
      367  I must be here confined by you,
      368  Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
      369  Since I have my dukedom got
      370  And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
      371  In this bare island by your spell;
      372  But release me from my bands
      373  With the help of your good hands:
      374  Gentle breath of yours my sails
      375  Must fill, or else my project fails,
      376  Which was to please. Now I want
      377  Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
      378  And my ending is despair,
      379  Unless I be relieved by prayer,
      380  Which pierces so that it assaults
      381  Mercy itself and frees all faults.
      382  As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
      383  Let your indulgence set me free.
