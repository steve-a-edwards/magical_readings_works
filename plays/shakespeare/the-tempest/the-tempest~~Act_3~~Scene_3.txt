          The Tempest : Act 3 : Scene 3

SCENE III. Another part of the island.
  Direction: Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others
    GONZALO
        1  By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
        2  My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
        3  Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
        4  I needs must rest me.
    ALONSO
        5  Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
        6  Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
        7  To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
        8  Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
        9  No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
       10  Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
       11  Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
    ANTONIO
       12  [Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's so
       13  out of hope.
       14  Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
       15  That you resolved to effect.
    SEBASTIAN
       16  [Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantage
       17  Will we take throughly.
    ANTONIO
       18  [Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night;
       19  For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
       20  Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
       21  As when they are fresh.
    SEBASTIAN
       22  [Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more.
  Direction: Solemn and strange music
    ALONSO
       23  What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
    GONZALO
       24  Marvellous sweet music!
  Direction: Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King and the to eat, they depart
    ALONSO
       25  Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
    SEBASTIAN
       26  A living drollery. Now I will believe
       27  That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
       28  There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
       29  At this hour reigning there.
    ANTONIO
       30  I'll believe both;
       31  And what does else want credit, come to me,
       32  And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
       33  lie,
       34  Though fools at home condemn 'em.
    GONZALO
       35  If in Naples
       36  I should report this now, would they believe me?
       37  If I should say, I saw such islanders--
       38  For, certes, these are people of the island--
       39  Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
       40  Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
       41  Our human generation you shall find
       42  Many, nay, almost any.
    PROSPERO
       43  [Aside] Honest lord,
       44  Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
       45  Are worse than devils.
    ALONSO
       46  I cannot too much muse
       47  Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
       48  Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
       49  Of excellent dumb discourse.
    PROSPERO
       50  [Aside] Praise in departing.
    FRANCISCO
       51  They vanish'd strangely.
    SEBASTIAN
       52  No matter, since
       53  They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
       54  Will't please you taste of what is here?
    ALONSO
       55  Not I.
    GONZALO
       56  Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
       57  Who would believe that there were mountaineers
       58  Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
       59  Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
       60  Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
       61  Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
       62  Good warrant of.
    ALONSO
       63  I will stand to and feed,
       64  Although my last: no matter, since I feel
       65  The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
       66  Stand to and do as we.
  Direction: Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes
    ARIEL
       67  You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
       68  That hath to instrument this lower world
       69  And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
       70  Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
       71  Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
       72  Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
       73  And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
       74  Their proper selves.
  Direction: ALONSO, SEBASTIAN and some of the courtiers draw their swords
       75  You fools! I and my fellows
       76  Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
       77  Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
       78  Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
       79  Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
       80  One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
       81  Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
       82  Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
       83  And will not be uplifted. But remember--
       84  For that's my business to you--that you three
       85  From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
       86  Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
       87  Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
       88  The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
       89  Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
       90  Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
       91  They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
       92  Lingering perdition, worse than any death
       93  Can be at once, shall step by step attend
       94  You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
       95  Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
       96  Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
       97  And a clear life ensuing.
  Direction: He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table
    PROSPERO
       98  Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
       99  Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
      100  Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
      101  In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
      102  And observation strange, my meaner ministers
      103  Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
      104  And these mine enemies are all knit up
      105  In their distractions; they now are in my power;
      106  And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
      107  Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
      108  And his and mine loved darling.
  Direction: Exit above
    GONZALO
      109  I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
      110  In this strange stare?
    ALONSO
      111  O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
      112  Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
      113  The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
      114  That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
      115  The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
      116  Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
      117  I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
      118  And with him there lie mudded.
  Direction: Exit
    SEBASTIAN
      119  But one fiend at a time,
      120  I'll fight their legions o'er.
    ANTONIO
      121  I'll be thy second.
  Direction: Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO
    GONZALO
      122  All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
      123  Like poison given to work a great time after,
      124  Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
      125  That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
      126  And hinder them from what this ecstasy
      127  May now provoke them to.
    ADRIAN
      128  Follow, I pray you.
  Direction: Exeunt
