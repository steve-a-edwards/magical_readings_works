          The Tempest : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S Cell.
  Direction: Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log
    FERDINAND
        1  There be some sports are painful, and their labour
        2  Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
        3  Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
        4  Point to rich ends. This my mean task
        5  Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
        6  The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
        7  And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
        8  Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
        9  And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
       10  Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
       11  Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
       12  Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
       13  Had never like executor. I forget:
       14  But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
       15  Most busy lest, when I do it.
  Direction: Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen
    MIRANDA
       16  Alas, now, pray you,
       17  Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
       18  Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
       19  Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
       20  'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
       21  Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
       22  He's safe for these three hours.
    FERDINAND
       23  O most dear mistress,
       24  The sun will set before I shall discharge
       25  What I must strive to do.
    MIRANDA
       26  If you'll sit down,
       27  I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
       28  I'll carry it to the pile.
    FERDINAND
       29  No, precious creature;
       30  I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
       31  Than you should such dishonour undergo,
       32  While I sit lazy by.
    MIRANDA
       33  It would become me
       34  As well as it does you: and I should do it
       35  With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
       36  And yours it is against.
    PROSPERO
       37  Poor worm, thou art infected!
       38  This visitation shows it.
    MIRANDA
       39  You look wearily.
    FERDINAND
       40  No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me
       41  When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
       42  Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
       43  What is your name?
    MIRANDA
       44  Miranda.--O my father,
       45  I have broke your hest to say so!
    FERDINAND
       46  Admired Miranda!
       47  Indeed the top of admiration! worth
       48  What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
       49  I have eyed with best regard and many a time
       50  The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
       51  Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
       52  Have I liked several women; never any
       53  With so fun soul, but some defect in her
       54  Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
       55  And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
       56  So perfect and so peerless, are created
       57  Of every creature's best!
    MIRANDA
       58  I do not know
       59  One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
       60  Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
       61  More that I may call men than you, good friend,
       62  And my dear father: how features are abroad,
       63  I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
       64  The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
       65  Any companion in the world but you,
       66  Nor can imagination form a shape,
       67  Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
       68  Something too wildly and my father's precepts
       69  I therein do forget.
    FERDINAND
       70  I am in my condition
       71  A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
       72  I would, not so!--and would no more endure
       73  This wooden slavery than to suffer
       74  The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
       75  The very instant that I saw you, did
       76  My heart fly to your service; there resides,
       77  To make me slave to it; and for your sake
       78  Am I this patient log--man.
    MIRANDA
       79  Do you love me?
    FERDINAND
       80  O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
       81  And crown what I profess with kind event
       82  If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
       83  What best is boded me to mischief! I
       84  Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
       85  Do love, prize, honour you.
    MIRANDA
       86  I am a fool
       87  To weep at what I am glad of.
    PROSPERO
       88  Fair encounter
       89  Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
       90  On that which breeds between 'em!
    FERDINAND
       91  Wherefore weep you?
    MIRANDA
       92  At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
       93  What I desire to give, and much less take
       94  What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
       95  And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
       96  The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
       97  And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
       98  I am your wife, if you will marry me;
       99  If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
      100  You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
      101  Whether you will or no.
    FERDINAND
      102  My mistress, dearest;
      103  And I thus humble ever.
    MIRANDA
      104  My husband, then?
    FERDINAND
      105  Ay, with a heart as willing
      106  As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
    MIRANDA
      107  And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell
      108  Till half an hour hence.
    FERDINAND
      109  A thousand thousand!
  Direction: Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally
    PROSPERO
      110  So glad of this as they I cannot be,
      111  Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
      112  At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,
      113  For yet ere supper-time must I perform
      114  Much business appertaining.
  Direction: Exit
