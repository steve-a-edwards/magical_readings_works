          The Tempest : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Another part of the island.
  Direction: Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others
    GONZALO
        1  Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
        2  So have we all, of joy; for our escape
        3  Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
        4  Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
        5  The masters of some merchant and the merchant
        6  Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
        7  I mean our preservation, few in millions
        8  Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
        9  Our sorrow with our comfort.
    ALONSO
       10  Prithee, peace.
    SEBASTIAN
       11  He receives comfort like cold porridge.
    ANTONIO
       12  The visitor will not give him o'er so.
    SEBASTIAN
       13  Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
       14  by and by it will strike.
    GONZALO
       15  Sir,--
    SEBASTIAN
       16  One: tell.
    GONZALO
       17  When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
       18  Comes to the entertainer--
    SEBASTIAN
       19  A dollar.
    GONZALO
       20  Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
       21  have spoken truer than you purposed.
    SEBASTIAN
       22  You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
    GONZALO
       23  Therefore, my lord,--
    ANTONIO
       24  Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
    ALONSO
       25  I prithee, spare.
    GONZALO
       26  Well, I have done: but yet,--
    SEBASTIAN
       27  He will be talking.
    ANTONIO
       28  Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
       29  wager, first begins to crow?
    SEBASTIAN
       30  The old cock.
    ANTONIO
       31  The cockerel.
    SEBASTIAN
       32  Done. The wager?
    ANTONIO
       33  A laughter.
    SEBASTIAN
       34  A match!
    ADRIAN
       35  Though this island seem to be desert,--
    SEBASTIAN
       36  Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.
    ADRIAN
       37  Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
    SEBASTIAN
       38  Yet,--
    ADRIAN
       39  Yet,--
    ANTONIO
       40  He could not miss't.
    ADRIAN
       41  It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
       42  temperance.
    ANTONIO
       43  Temperance was a delicate wench.
    SEBASTIAN
       44  Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
    ADRIAN
       45  The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
    SEBASTIAN
       46  As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
    ANTONIO
       47  Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
    GONZALO
       48  Here is everything advantageous to life.
    ANTONIO
       49  True; save means to live.
    SEBASTIAN
       50  Of that there's none, or little.
    GONZALO
       51  How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
    ANTONIO
       52  The ground indeed is tawny.
    SEBASTIAN
       53  With an eye of green in't.
    ANTONIO
       54  He misses not much.
    SEBASTIAN
       55  No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
    GONZALO
       56  But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
       57  beyond credit,--
    SEBASTIAN
       58  As many vouched rarities are.
    GONZALO
       59  That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
       60  the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
       61  glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
       62  salt water.
    ANTONIO
       63  If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
       64  say he lies?
    SEBASTIAN
       65  Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report
    GONZALO
       66  Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
       67  put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
       68  the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
    SEBASTIAN
       69  'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
    ADRIAN
       70  Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
       71  their queen.
    GONZALO
       72  Not since widow Dido's time.
    ANTONIO
       73  Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
       74  widow Dido!
    SEBASTIAN
       75  What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
       76  how you take it!
    ADRIAN
       77  'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
       78  she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
    GONZALO
       79  This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
    ADRIAN
       80  Carthage?
    GONZALO
       81  I assure you, Carthage.
    SEBASTIAN
       82  His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
       83  raised the wall and houses too.
    ANTONIO
       84  What impossible matter will he make easy next?
    SEBASTIAN
       85  I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
       86  and give it his son for an apple.
    ANTONIO
       87  And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
       88  forth more islands.
    GONZALO
       89  Ay.
    ANTONIO
       90  Why, in good time.
    GONZALO
       91  Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
       92  as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
       93  of your daughter, who is now queen.
    ANTONIO
       94  And the rarest that e'er came there.
    SEBASTIAN
       95  Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
    ANTONIO
       96  O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
    GONZALO
       97  Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
       98  wore it? I mean, in a sort.
    ANTONIO
       99  That sort was well fished for.
    GONZALO
      100  When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
    ALONSO
      101  You cram these words into mine ears against
      102  The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
      103  Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
      104  My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
      105  Who is so far from Italy removed
      106  I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
      107  Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
      108  Hath made his meal on thee?
    FRANCISCO
      109  Sir, he may live:
      110  I saw him beat the surges under him,
      111  And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
      112  Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
      113  The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
      114  'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
      115  Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
      116  To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
      117  As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
      118  He came alive to land.
    ALONSO
      119  No, no, he's gone.
    SEBASTIAN
      120  Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
      121  That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
      122  But rather lose her to an African;
      123  Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
      124  Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
    ALONSO
      125  Prithee, peace.
    SEBASTIAN
      126  You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
      127  By all of us, and the fair soul herself
      128  Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
      129  Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
      130  son,
      131  I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
      132  More widows in them of this business' making
      133  Than we bring men to comfort them:
      134  The fault's your own.
    ALONSO
      135  So is the dear'st o' the loss.
    GONZALO
      136  My lord Sebastian,
      137  The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
      138  And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
      139  When you should bring the plaster.
    SEBASTIAN
      140  Very well.
    ANTONIO
      141  And most chirurgeonly.
    GONZALO
      142  It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
      143  When you are cloudy.
    SEBASTIAN
      144  Foul weather?
    ANTONIO
      145  Very foul.
    GONZALO
      146  Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
    ANTONIO
      147  He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
    SEBASTIAN
      148  Or docks, or mallows.
    GONZALO
      149  And were the king on't, what would I do?
    SEBASTIAN
      150  'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
    GONZALO
      151  I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
      152  Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
      153  Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
      154  Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
      155  And use of service, none; contract, succession,
      156  Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
      157  No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
      158  No occupation; all men idle, all;
      159  And women too, but innocent and pure;
      160  No sovereignty;--
    SEBASTIAN
      161  Yet he would be king on't.
    ANTONIO
      162  The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
      163  beginning.
    GONZALO
      164  All things in common nature should produce
      165  Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
      166  Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
      167  Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
      168  Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
      169  To feed my innocent people.
    SEBASTIAN
      170  No marrying 'mong his subjects?
    ANTONIO
      171  None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
    GONZALO
      172  I would with such perfection govern, sir,
      173  To excel the golden age.
    SEBASTIAN
      174  God save his majesty!
    ANTONIO
      175  Long live Gonzalo!
    GONZALO
      176  And,--do you mark me, sir?
    ALONSO
      177  Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
    GONZALO
      178  I do well believe your highness; and
      179  did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
      180  who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
      181  they always use to laugh at nothing.
    ANTONIO
      182  'Twas you we laughed at.
    GONZALO
      183  Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
      184  to you: so you may continue and laugh at
      185  nothing still.
    ANTONIO
      186  What a blow was there given!
    SEBASTIAN
      187  An it had not fallen flat-long.
    GONZALO
      188  You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
      189  the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
      190  in it five weeks without changing.
  Direction: Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music
    SEBASTIAN
      191  We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
    ANTONIO
      192  Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
    GONZALO
      193  No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
      194  my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
      195  me asleep, for I am very heavy?
    ANTONIO
      196  Go sleep, and hear us.
  Direction: All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO
    ALONSO
      197  What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
      198  Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
      199  They are inclined to do so.
    SEBASTIAN
      200  Please you, sir,
      201  Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
      202  It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
      203  It is a comforter.
    ANTONIO
      204  We two, my lord,
      205  Will guard your person while you take your rest,
      206  And watch your safety.
    ALONSO
      207  Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
  Direction: ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL
    SEBASTIAN
      208  What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
    ANTONIO
      209  It is the quality o' the climate.
    SEBASTIAN
      210  Why
      211  Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
      212  Myself disposed to sleep.
    ANTONIO
      213  Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
      214  They fell together all, as by consent;
      215  They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
      216  Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
      217  And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
      218  What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
      219  My strong imagination sees a crown
      220  Dropping upon thy head.
    SEBASTIAN
      221  What, art thou waking?
    ANTONIO
      222  Do you not hear me speak?
    SEBASTIAN
      223  I do; and surely
      224  It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
      225  Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
      226  This is a strange repose, to be asleep
      227  With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
      228  And yet so fast asleep.
    ANTONIO
      229  Noble Sebastian,
      230  Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
      231  Whiles thou art waking.
    SEBASTIAN
      232  Thou dost snore distinctly;
      233  There's meaning in thy snores.
    ANTONIO
      234  I am more serious than my custom: you
      235  Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
      236  Trebles thee o'er.
    SEBASTIAN
      237  Well, I am standing water.
    ANTONIO
      238  I'll teach you how to flow.
    SEBASTIAN
      239  Do so: to ebb
      240  Hereditary sloth instructs me.
    ANTONIO
      241  O,
      242  If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
      243  Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
      244  You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
      245  Most often do so near the bottom run
      246  By their own fear or sloth.
    SEBASTIAN
      247  Prithee, say on:
      248  The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
      249  A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
      250  Which throes thee much to yield.
    ANTONIO
      251  Thus, sir:
      252  Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
      253  Who shall be of as little memory
      254  When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
      255  For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
      256  Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
      257  'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
      258  And he that sleeps here swims.
    SEBASTIAN
      259  I have no hope
      260  That he's undrown'd.
    ANTONIO
      261  O, out of that 'no hope'
      262  What great hope have you! no hope that way is
      263  Another way so high a hope that even
      264  Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
      265  But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
      266  That Ferdinand is drown'd?
    SEBASTIAN
      267  He's gone.
    ANTONIO
      268  Then, tell me,
      269  Who's the next heir of Naples?
    SEBASTIAN
      270  Claribel.
    ANTONIO
      271  She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
      272  Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
      273  Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
      274  The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
      275  Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
      276  We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
      277  And by that destiny to perform an act
      278  Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
      279  In yours and my discharge.
    SEBASTIAN
      280  What stuff is this! how say you?
      281  'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
      282  So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
      283  There is some space.
    ANTONIO
      284  A space whose every cubit
      285  Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
      286  Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
      287  And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
      288  That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
      289  Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
      290  As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
      291  As amply and unnecessarily
      292  As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
      293  A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
      294  The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
      295  For your advancement! Do you understand me?
    SEBASTIAN
      296  Methinks I do.
    ANTONIO
      297  And how does your content
      298  Tender your own good fortune?
    SEBASTIAN
      299  I remember
      300  You did supplant your brother Prospero.
    ANTONIO
      301  True:
      302  And look how well my garments sit upon me;
      303  Much feater than before: my brother's servants
      304  Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
    SEBASTIAN
      305  But, for your conscience?
    ANTONIO
      306  Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
      307  'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
      308  This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
      309  That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
      310  And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
      311  No better than the earth he lies upon,
      312  If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
      313  Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
      314  Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
      315  To the perpetual wink for aye might put
      316  This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
      317  Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
      318  They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
      319  They'll tell the clock to any business that
      320  We say befits the hour.
    SEBASTIAN
      321  Thy case, dear friend,
      322  Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
      323  I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
      324  Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
      325  And I the king shall love thee.
    ANTONIO
      326  Draw together;
      327  And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
      328  To fall it on Gonzalo.
    SEBASTIAN
      329  O, but one word.
  Direction: They talk apart
  Direction: Re-enter ARIEL, invisible
    ARIEL
      330  My master through his art foresees the danger
      331  That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
      332  For else his project dies--to keep them living.
  Direction: Sings in GONZALO's ear
      333  While you here do snoring lie,
      334  Open-eyed conspiracy
      335  His time doth take.
      336  If of life you keep a care,
      337  Shake off slumber, and beware:
      338  Awake, awake!
    ANTONIO
      339  Then let us both be sudden.
    GONZALO
      340  Now, good angels
      341  Preserve the king.
  Direction: They wake
    ALONSO
      342  Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
      343  Wherefore this ghastly looking?
    GONZALO
      344  What's the matter?
    SEBASTIAN
      345  Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
      346  Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
      347  Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?
      348  It struck mine ear most terribly.
    ALONSO
      349  I heard nothing.
    ANTONIO
      350  O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
      351  To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
      352  Of a whole herd of lions.
    ALONSO
      353  Heard you this, Gonzalo?
    GONZALO
      354  Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
      355  And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
      356  I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
      357  I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
      358  That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
      359  Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.
    ALONSO
      360  Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
      361  For my poor son.
    GONZALO
      362  Heavens keep him from these beasts!
      363  For he is, sure, i' the island.
    ALONSO
      364  Lead away.
    ARIEL
      365  Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
      366  So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.
  Direction: Exeunt
