          The Tempest : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
  Direction: Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA
    MIRANDA
        1  If by your art, my dearest father, you have
        2  Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
        3  The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
        4  But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
        5  Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
        6  With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
        7  Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
        8  Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
        9  Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
       10  Had I been any god of power, I would
       11  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
       12  It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
       13  The fraughting souls within her.
    PROSPERO
       14  Be collected:
       15  No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
       16  There's no harm done.
    MIRANDA
       17  O, woe the day!
    PROSPERO
       18  No harm.
       19  I have done nothing but in care of thee,
       20  Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
       21  Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
       22  Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
       23  Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
       24  And thy no greater father.
    MIRANDA
       25  More to know
       26  Did never meddle with my thoughts.
    PROSPERO
       27  'Tis time
       28  I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
       29  And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
  Direction: Lays down his mantle
       30  Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
       31  The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
       32  The very virtue of compassion in thee,
       33  I have with such provision in mine art
       34  So safely ordered that there is no soul--
       35  No, not so much perdition as an hair
       36  Betid to any creature in the vessel
       37  Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
       38  For thou must now know farther.
    MIRANDA
       39  You have often
       40  Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
       41  And left me to a bootless inquisition,
       42  Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
    PROSPERO
       43  The hour's now come;
       44  The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
       45  Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
       46  A time before we came unto this cell?
       47  I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
       48  Out three years old.
    MIRANDA
       49  Certainly, sir, I can.
    PROSPERO
       50  By what? by any other house or person?
       51  Of any thing the image tell me that
       52  Hath kept with thy remembrance.
    MIRANDA
       53  'Tis far off
       54  And rather like a dream than an assurance
       55  That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
       56  Four or five women once that tended me?
    PROSPERO
       57  Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
       58  That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
       59  In the dark backward and abysm of time?
       60  If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
       61  How thou camest here thou mayst.
    MIRANDA
       62  But that I do not.
    PROSPERO
       63  Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
       64  Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
       65  A prince of power.
    MIRANDA
       66  Sir, are not you my father?
    PROSPERO
       67  Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
       68  She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
       69  Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
       70  And princess no worse issued.
    MIRANDA
       71  O the heavens!
       72  What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
       73  Or blessed was't we did?
    PROSPERO
       74  Both, both, my girl:
       75  By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
       76  But blessedly holp hither.
    MIRANDA
       77  O, my heart bleeds
       78  To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
       79  Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
    PROSPERO
       80  My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
       81  I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
       82  Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
       83  Of all the world I loved and to him put
       84  The manage of my state; as at that time
       85  Through all the signories it was the first
       86  And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
       87  In dignity, and for the liberal arts
       88  Without a parallel; those being all my study,
       89  The government I cast upon my brother
       90  And to my state grew stranger, being transported
       91  And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
       92  Dost thou attend me?
    MIRANDA
       93  Sir, most heedfully.
    PROSPERO
       94  Being once perfected how to grant suits,
       95  How to deny them, who to advance and who
       96  To trash for over-topping, new created
       97  The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
       98  Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
       99  Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
      100  To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
      101  The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
      102  And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
    MIRANDA
      103  O, good sir, I do.
    PROSPERO
      104  I pray thee, mark me.
      105  I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
      106  To closeness and the bettering of my mind
      107  With that which, but by being so retired,
      108  O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
      109  Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
      110  Like a good parent, did beget of him
      111  A falsehood in its contrary as great
      112  As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
      113  A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
      114  Not only with what my revenue yielded,
      115  But what my power might else exact, like one
      116  Who having into truth, by telling of it,
      117  Made such a sinner of his memory,
      118  To credit his own lie, he did believe
      119  He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
      120  And executing the outward face of royalty,
      121  With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
      122  Dost thou hear?
    MIRANDA
      123  Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
    PROSPERO
      124  To have no screen between this part he play'd
      125  And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
      126  Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
      127  Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
      128  He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
      129  So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
      130  To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
      131  Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
      132  The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
      133  To most ignoble stooping.
    MIRANDA
      134  O the heavens!
    PROSPERO
      135  Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
      136  If this might be a brother.
    MIRANDA
      137  I should sin
      138  To think but nobly of my grandmother:
      139  Good wombs have borne bad sons.
    PROSPERO
      140  Now the condition.
      141  The King of Naples, being an enemy
      142  To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
      143  Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
      144  Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
      145  Should presently extirpate me and mine
      146  Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
      147  With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
      148  A treacherous army levied, one midnight
      149  Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
      150  The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
      151  The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
      152  Me and thy crying self.
    MIRANDA
      153  Alack, for pity!
      154  I, not remembering how I cried out then,
      155  Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
      156  That wrings mine eyes to't.
    PROSPERO
      157  Hear a little further
      158  And then I'll bring thee to the present business
      159  Which now's upon's; without the which this story
      160  Were most impertinent.
    MIRANDA
      161  Wherefore did they not
      162  That hour destroy us?
    PROSPERO
      163  Well demanded, wench:
      164  My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
      165  So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
      166  A mark so bloody on the business, but
      167  With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
      168  In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
      169  Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
      170  A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
      171  Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
      172  Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
      173  To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
      174  To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
      175  Did us but loving wrong.
    MIRANDA
      176  Alack, what trouble
      177  Was I then to you!
    PROSPERO
      178  O, a cherubim
      179  Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
      180  Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
      181  When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
      182  Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
      183  An undergoing stomach, to bear up
      184  Against what should ensue.
    MIRANDA
      185  How came we ashore?
    PROSPERO
      186  By Providence divine.
      187  Some food we had and some fresh water that
      188  A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
      189  Out of his charity, being then appointed
      190  Master of this design, did give us, with
      191  Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
      192  Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
      193  Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
      194  From mine own library with volumes that
      195  I prize above my dukedom.
    MIRANDA
      196  Would I might
      197  But ever see that man!
    PROSPERO
      198  Now I arise:
  Direction: Resumes his mantle
      199  Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
      200  Here in this island we arrived; and here
      201  Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
      202  Than other princesses can that have more time
      203  For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
    MIRANDA
      204  Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
      205  For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
      206  For raising this sea-storm?
    PROSPERO
      207  Know thus far forth.
      208  By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
      209  Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
      210  Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
      211  I find my zenith doth depend upon
      212  A most auspicious star, whose influence
      213  If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
      214  Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
      215  Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
      216  And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
  Direction: MIRANDA sleeps
      217  Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
      218  Approach, my Ariel, come.
  Direction: Enter ARIEL
    ARIEL
      219  All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
      220  To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
      221  To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
      222  On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
      223  Ariel and all his quality.
    PROSPERO
      224  Hast thou, spirit,
      225  Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
    ARIEL
      226  To every article.
      227  I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
      228  Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
      229  I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
      230  And burn in many places; on the topmast,
      231  The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
      232  Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
      233  O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
      234  And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
      235  Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
      236  Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
      237  Yea, his dread trident shake.
    PROSPERO
      238  My brave spirit!
      239  Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
      240  Would not infect his reason?
    ARIEL
      241  Not a soul
      242  But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
      243  Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
      244  Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
      245  Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
      246  With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
      247  Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
      248  And all the devils are here.'
    PROSPERO
      249  Why that's my spirit!
      250  But was not this nigh shore?
    ARIEL
      251  Close by, my master.
    PROSPERO
      252  But are they, Ariel, safe?
    ARIEL
      253  Not a hair perish'd;
      254  On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
      255  But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
      256  In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
      257  The king's son have I landed by himself;
      258  Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
      259  In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
      260  His arms in this sad knot.
    PROSPERO
      261  Of the king's ship
      262  The mariners say how thou hast disposed
      263  And all the rest o' the fleet.
    ARIEL
      264  Safely in harbour
      265  Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
      266  Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
      267  From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
      268  The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
      269  Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
      270  I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
      271  Which I dispersed, they all have met again
      272  And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
      273  Bound sadly home for Naples,
      274  Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
      275  And his great person perish.
    PROSPERO
      276  Ariel, thy charge
      277  Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
      278  What is the time o' the day?
    ARIEL
      279  Past the mid season.
    PROSPERO
      280  At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
      281  Must by us both be spent most preciously.
    ARIEL
      282  Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
      283  Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
      284  Which is not yet perform'd me.
    PROSPERO
      285  How now? moody?
      286  What is't thou canst demand?
    ARIEL
      287  My liberty.
    PROSPERO
      288  Before the time be out? no more!
    ARIEL
      289  I prithee,
      290  Remember I have done thee worthy service;
      291  Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
      292  Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
      293  To bate me a full year.
    PROSPERO
      294  Dost thou forget
      295  From what a torment I did free thee?
    ARIEL
      296  No.
    PROSPERO
      297  Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
      298  Of the salt deep,
      299  To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
      300  To do me business in the veins o' the earth
      301  When it is baked with frost.
    ARIEL
      302  I do not, sir.
    PROSPERO
      303  Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
      304  The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
      305  Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
    ARIEL
      306  No, sir.
    PROSPERO
      307  Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.
    ARIEL
      308  Sir, in Argier.
    PROSPERO
      309  O, was she so? I must
      310  Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
      311  Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
      312  For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
      313  To enter human hearing, from Argier,
      314  Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
      315  They would not take her life. Is not this true?
    ARIEL
      316  Ay, sir.
    PROSPERO
      317  This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
      318  And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
      319  As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
      320  And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
      321  To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
      322  Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
      323  By help of her more potent ministers
      324  And in her most unmitigable rage,
      325  Into a cloven pine; within which rift
      326  Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
      327  A dozen years; within which space she died
      328  And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
      329  As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
      330  Save for the son that she did litter here,
      331  A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
      332  A human shape.
    ARIEL
      333  Yes, Caliban her son.
    PROSPERO
      334  Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
      335  Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
      336  What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
      337  Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
      338  Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
      339  To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
      340  Could not again undo: it was mine art,
      341  When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
      342  The pine and let thee out.
    ARIEL
      343  I thank thee, master.
    PROSPERO
      344  If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
      345  And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
      346  Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
    ARIEL
      347  Pardon, master;
      348  I will be correspondent to command
      349  And do my spiriting gently.
    PROSPERO
      350  Do so, and after two days
      351  I will discharge thee.
    ARIEL
      352  That's my noble master!
      353  What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?
    PROSPERO
      354  Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
      355  To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
      356  To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
      357  And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
  Direction: Exit ARIEL
      358  Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!
    MIRANDA
      359  The strangeness of your story put
      360  Heaviness in me.
    PROSPERO
      361  Shake it off. Come on;
      362  We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
      363  Yields us kind answer.
    MIRANDA
      364  'Tis a villain, sir,
      365  I do not love to look on.
    PROSPERO
      366  But, as 'tis,
      367  We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
      368  Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
      369  That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
      370  Thou earth, thou! speak.
    CALIBAN
      371  [Within] There's wood enough within.
    PROSPERO
      372  Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
      373  Come, thou tortoise! when?
  Direction: Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph
      374  Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
      375  Hark in thine ear.
    ARIEL
      376  My lord it shall be done.
  Direction: Exit
    PROSPERO
      377  Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
      378  Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
  Direction: Enter CALIBAN
    CALIBAN
      379  As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
      380  With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
      381  Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
      382  And blister you all o'er!
    PROSPERO
      383  For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
      384  Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
      385  Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
      386  All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
      387  As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
      388  Than bees that made 'em.
    CALIBAN
      389  I must eat my dinner.
      390  This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
      391  Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
      392  Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
      393  Water with berries in't, and teach me how
      394  To name the bigger light, and how the less,
      395  That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
      396  And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
      397  The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
      398  Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
      399  Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
      400  For I am all the subjects that you have,
      401  Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
      402  In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
      403  The rest o' the island.
    PROSPERO
      404  Thou most lying slave,
      405  Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
      406  Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
      407  In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
      408  The honour of my child.
    CALIBAN
      409  O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
      410  Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
      411  This isle with Calibans.
    PROSPERO
      412  Abhorred slave,
      413  Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
      414  Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
      415  Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
      416  One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
      417  Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
      418  A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
      419  With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
      420  Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
      421  good natures
      422  Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
      423  Deservedly confined into this rock,
      424  Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
    CALIBAN
      425  You taught me language; and my profit on't
      426  Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
      427  For learning me your language!
    PROSPERO
      428  Hag-seed, hence!
      429  Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
      430  To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
      431  If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
      432  What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
      433  Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
      434  That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
    CALIBAN
      435  No, pray thee.
  Direction: Aside
      436  I must obey: his art is of such power,
      437  It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
      438  and make a vassal of him.
    PROSPERO
      439  So, slave; hence!
  Direction: Exit CALIBAN
  Direction: Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND following
      440  ARIEL'S song.
      441  Come unto these yellow sands,
      442  And then take hands:
      443  Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
      444  The wild waves whist,
      445  Foot it featly here and there;
      446  And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
      447  Hark, hark!
  Direction: Burthen [dispersedly, within
      448  The watch-dogs bark!
  Direction: Burthen Bow-wow
      449  Hark, hark! I hear
      450  The strain of strutting chanticleer
      451  Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.
    FERDINAND
      452  Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
      453  It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
      454  Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
      455  Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
      456  This music crept by me upon the waters,
      457  Allaying both their fury and my passion
      458  With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
      459  Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
      460  No, it begins again.
  Direction: ARIEL sings
      461  Full fathom five thy father lies;
      462  Of his bones are coral made;
      463  Those are pearls that were his eyes:
      464  Nothing of him that doth fade
      465  But doth suffer a sea-change
      466  Into something rich and strange.
      467  Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
  Direction: Burthen Ding-dong
      468  Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.
    FERDINAND
      469  The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
      470  This is no mortal business, nor no sound
      471  That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
    PROSPERO
      472  The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
      473  And say what thou seest yond.
    MIRANDA
      474  What is't? a spirit?
      475  Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
      476  It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
    PROSPERO
      477  No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
      478  As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
      479  Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
      480  With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
      481  A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
      482  And strays about to find 'em.
    MIRANDA
      483  I might call him
      484  A thing divine, for nothing natural
      485  I ever saw so noble.
    PROSPERO
      486  [Aside] It goes on, I see,
      487  As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
      488  Within two days for this.
    FERDINAND
      489  Most sure, the goddess
      490  On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
      491  May know if you remain upon this island;
      492  And that you will some good instruction give
      493  How I may bear me here: my prime request,
      494  Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
      495  If you be maid or no?
    MIRANDA
      496  No wonder, sir;
      497  But certainly a maid.
    FERDINAND
      498  My language! heavens!
      499  I am the best of them that speak this speech,
      500  Were I but where 'tis spoken.
    PROSPERO
      501  How? the best?
      502  What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
    FERDINAND
      503  A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
      504  To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
      505  And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
      506  Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
      507  The king my father wreck'd.
    MIRANDA
      508  Alack, for mercy!
    FERDINAND
      509  Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
      510  And his brave son being twain.
    PROSPERO
      511  [Aside] The Duke of Milan
      512  And his more braver daughter could control thee,
      513  If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
      514  They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
      515  I'll set thee free for this.
  Direction: To FERDINAND
      516  A word, good sir;
      517  I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
    MIRANDA
      518  Why speaks my father so ungently? This
      519  Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
      520  That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
      521  To be inclined my way!
    FERDINAND
      522  O, if a virgin,
      523  And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
      524  The queen of Naples.
    PROSPERO
      525  Soft, sir! one word more.
  Direction: Aside
      526  They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
      527  I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
      528  Make the prize light.
  Direction: To FERDINAND
      529  One word more; I charge thee
      530  That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
      531  The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
      532  Upon this island as a spy, to win it
      533  From me, the lord on't.
    FERDINAND
      534  No, as I am a man.
    MIRANDA
      535  There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
      536  If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
      537  Good things will strive to dwell with't.
    PROSPERO
      538  Follow me.
      539  Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
      540  I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
      541  Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
      542  The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
      543  Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
    FERDINAND
      544  No;
      545  I will resist such entertainment till
      546  Mine enemy has more power.
  Direction: Draws, and is charmed from moving
    MIRANDA
      547  O dear father,
      548  Make not too rash a trial of him, for
      549  He's gentle and not fearful.
    PROSPERO
      550  What? I say,
      551  My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
      552  Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
      553  Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
      554  For I can here disarm thee with this stick
      555  And make thy weapon drop.
    MIRANDA
      556  Beseech you, father.
    PROSPERO
      557  Hence! hang not on my garments.
    MIRANDA
      558  Sir, have pity;
      559  I'll be his surety.
    PROSPERO
      560  Silence! one word more
      561  Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
      562  An advocate for an imposter! hush!
      563  Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
      564  Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
      565  To the most of men this is a Caliban
      566  And they to him are angels.
    MIRANDA
      567  My affections
      568  Are then most humble; I have no ambition
      569  To see a goodlier man.
    PROSPERO
      570  Come on; obey:
      571  Thy nerves are in their infancy again
      572  And have no vigour in them.
    FERDINAND
      573  So they are;
      574  My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
      575  My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
      576  The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
      577  To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
      578  Might I but through my prison once a day
      579  Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
      580  Let liberty make use of; space enough
      581  Have I in such a prison.
    PROSPERO
      582  [Aside] It works.
  Direction: To FERDINAND
      583  Come on.
      584  Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
  Direction: To FERDINAND
      585  Follow me.
  Direction: To ARIEL
      586  Hark what thou else shalt do me.
    MIRANDA
      587  Be of comfort;
      588  My father's of a better nature, sir,
      589  Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
      590  Which now came from him.
    PROSPERO
      591  Thou shalt be free
      592  As mountain winds: but then exactly do
      593  All points of my command.
    ARIEL
      594  To the syllable.
    PROSPERO
      595  Come, follow. Speak not for him.
  Direction: Exeunt
