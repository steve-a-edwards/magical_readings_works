          The Tempest : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.
  Direction: Enter a Master and a Boatswain
    Master
        1  Boatswain!
    Boatswain
        2  Here, master: what cheer?
    Master
        3  Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
        4  or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter Mariners
    Boatswain
        5  Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
        6  yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
        7  master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
        8  if room enough!
  Direction: Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others
    ALONSO
        9  Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
       10  Play the men.
    Boatswain
       11  I pray now, keep below.
    ANTONIO
       12  Where is the master, boatswain?
    Boatswain
       13  Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
       14  cabins: you do assist the storm.
    GONZALO
       15  Nay, good, be patient.
    Boatswain
       16  When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
       17  for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
    GONZALO
       18  Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
    Boatswain
       19  None that I more love than myself. You are a
       20  counsellor; if you can command these elements to
       21  silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
       22  not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
       23  cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
       24  yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
       25  the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
       26  of our way, I say.
  Direction: Exit
    GONZALO
       27  I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
       28  hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
       29  perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
       30  hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
       31  for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
       32  born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
  Direction: Exeunt
  Direction: Re-enter Boatswain
    Boatswain
       33  Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
       34  her to try with main-course.
  Direction: A cry within
       35  A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
       36  the weather or our office.
  Direction: Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO
       37  Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
       38  and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
    SEBASTIAN
       39  A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
       40  incharitable dog!
    Boatswain
       41  Work you then.
    ANTONIO
       42  Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
       43  We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
    GONZALO
       44  I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
       45  no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
       46  unstanched wench.
    Boatswain
       47  Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
       48  sea again; lay her off.
  Direction: Enter Mariners wet
    Mariners
       49  All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
    Boatswain
       50  What, must our mouths be cold?
    GONZALO
       51  The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
       52  For our case is as theirs.
    SEBASTIAN
       53  I'm out of patience.
    ANTONIO
       54  We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
       55  This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
       56  The washing of ten tides!
    GONZALO
       57  He'll be hang'd yet,
       58  Though every drop of water swear against it
       59  And gape at widest to glut him.
  Direction: A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-- 'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'
    ANTONIO
       60  Let's all sink with the king.
    SEBASTIAN
       61  Let's take leave of him.
  Direction: Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
    GONZALO
       62  Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
       63  acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
       64  thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
       65  die a dry death.
  Direction: Exeunt
