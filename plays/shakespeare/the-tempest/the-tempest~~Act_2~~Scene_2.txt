          The Tempest : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Another part of the island.
  Direction: Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard
    CALIBAN
        1  All the infections that the sun sucks up
        2  From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
        3  By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
        4  And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
        5  Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,
        6  Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
        7  Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
        8  For every trifle are they set upon me;
        9  Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
       10  And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
       11  Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
       12  Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
       13  All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
       14  Do hiss me into madness.
  Direction: Enter TRINCULO
       15  Lo, now, lo!
       16  Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
       17  For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
       18  Perchance he will not mind me.
    TRINCULO
       19  Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off
       20  any weather at all, and another storm brewing;
       21  I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
       22  cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
       23  bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
       24  should thunder as it did before, I know not
       25  where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
       26  choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
       27  here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
       28  he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-
       29  like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
       30  John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
       31  as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
       32  not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
       33  of silver: there would this monster make a
       34  man; any strange beast there makes a man:
       35  when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
       36  beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
       37  Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
       38  arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
       39  my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
       40  but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
       41  thunderbolt.
  Direction: Thunder
       42  Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to
       43  creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
       44  shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
       45  strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
       46  dregs of the storm be past.
  Direction: Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand
    STEPHANO
       47  I shall no more to sea, to sea,
       48  Here shall I die ashore--
       49  This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
       50  funeral: well, here's my comfort.
  Direction: Drinks
  Direction: Sings
       51  The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,
       52  The gunner and his mate
       53  Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,
       54  But none of us cared for Kate;
       55  For she had a tongue with a tang,
       56  Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
       57  She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
       58  Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:
       59  Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
       60  This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.
  Direction: Drinks
    CALIBAN
       61  Do not torment me: Oh!
    STEPHANO
       62  What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
       63  tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
       64  have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
       65  four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as
       66  ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;
       67  and it shall be said so again while Stephano
       68  breathes at's nostrils.
    CALIBAN
       69  The spirit torments me; Oh!
    STEPHANO
       70  This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
       71  hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
       72  should he learn our language? I will give him some
       73  relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
       74  and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a
       75  present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.
    CALIBAN
       76  Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.
    STEPHANO
       77  He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
       78  wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
       79  never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
       80  fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
       81  not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that
       82  hath him, and that soundly.
    CALIBAN
       83  Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I
       84  know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.
    STEPHANO
       85  Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
       86  which will give language to you, cat: open your
       87  mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,
       88  and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:
       89  open your chaps again.
    TRINCULO
       90  I should know that voice: it should be--but he is
       91  drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!
    STEPHANO
       92  Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!
       93  His forward voice now is to speak well of his
       94  friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
       95  and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
       96  recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I
       97  will pour some in thy other mouth.
    TRINCULO
       98  Stephano!
    STEPHANO
       99  Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is
      100  a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no
      101  long spoon.
    TRINCULO
      102  Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and
      103  speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy
      104  good friend Trinculo.
    STEPHANO
      105  If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee
      106  by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,
      107  these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
      108  camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
      109  he vent Trinculos?
    TRINCULO
      110  I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But
      111  art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art
      112  not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
      113  under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
      114  the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O
      115  Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!
    STEPHANO
      116  Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.
    CALIBAN
      117  [Aside] These be fine things, an if they be
      118  not sprites.
      119  That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
      120  I will kneel to him.
    STEPHANO
      121  How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
      122  swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
      123  escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
      124  heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of
      125  the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
      126  cast ashore.
    CALIBAN
      127  I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;
      128  for the liquor is not earthly.
    STEPHANO
      129  Here; swear then how thou escapedst.
    TRINCULO
      130  Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a
      131  duck, I'll be sworn.
    STEPHANO
      132  Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
      133  duck, thou art made like a goose.
    TRINCULO
      134  O Stephano. hast any more of this?
    STEPHANO
      135  The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the
      136  sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!
      137  how does thine ague?
    CALIBAN
      138  Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
    STEPHANO
      139  Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'
      140  the moon when time was.
    CALIBAN
      141  I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
      142  My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
    STEPHANO
      143  Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
      144  it anon with new contents swear.
    TRINCULO
      145  By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
      146  I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'
      147  the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
      148  drawn, monster, in good sooth!
    CALIBAN
      149  I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
      150  And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.
    TRINCULO
      151  By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
      152  monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.
    CALIBAN
      153  I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.
    STEPHANO
      154  Come on then; down, and swear.
    TRINCULO
      155  I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
      156  monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my
      157  heart to beat him,--
    STEPHANO
      158  Come, kiss.
    TRINCULO
      159  But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!
    CALIBAN
      160  I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
      161  I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
      162  A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
      163  I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
      164  Thou wondrous man.
    TRINCULO
      165  A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a
      166  Poor drunkard!
    CALIBAN
      167  I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
      168  And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
      169  Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
      170  To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
      171  To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
      172  Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
    STEPHANO
      173  I prithee now, lead the way without any more
      174  talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company
      175  else being drowned, we will inherit here: here;
      176  bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by
      177  and by again.
    CALIBAN
      178  [Sings drunkenly]
      179  Farewell master; farewell, farewell!
    TRINCULO
      180  A howling monster: a drunken monster!
    CALIBAN
      181  No more dams I'll make for fish
      182  Nor fetch in firing
      183  At requiring;
      184  Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish
      185  'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
      186  Has a new master: get a new man.
      187  Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,
      188  hey-day, freedom!
    STEPHANO
      189  O brave monster! Lead the way.
  Direction: Exeunt
