          As You Like It : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A room in the palace.
  Direction: Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords
    DUKE FREDERICK
        1  Can it be possible that no man saw them?
        2  It cannot be: some villains of my court
        3  Are of consent and sufferance in this.
    First Lord
        4  I cannot hear of any that did see her.
        5  The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
        6  Saw her abed, and in the morning early
        7  They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
    Second Lord
        8  My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
        9  Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
       10  Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,
       11  Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
       12  Your daughter and her cousin much commend
       13  The parts and graces of the wrestler
       14  That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
       15  And she believes, wherever they are gone,
       16  That youth is surely in their company.
    DUKE FREDERICK
       17  Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
       18  If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
       19  I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
       20  And let not search and inquisition quail
       21  To bring again these foolish runaways.
  Direction: Exeunt
