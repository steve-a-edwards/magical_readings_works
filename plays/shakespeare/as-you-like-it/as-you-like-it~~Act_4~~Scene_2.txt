          As You Like It : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The forest.
  Direction: Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters
    JAQUES
        1  Which is he that killed the deer?
    A Lord
        2  Sir, it was I.
    JAQUES
        3  Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman
        4  conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
        5  horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
        6  you no song, forester, for this purpose?
    Forester
        7  Yes, sir.
    JAQUES
        8  Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
        9  make noise enough.
       10  SONG.
    Forester
       11  What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
       12  His leather skin and horns to wear.
       13  Then sing him home;
  Direction: The rest shall bear this burden
       14  Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
       15  It was a crest ere thou wast born:
       16  Thy father's father wore it,
       17  And thy father bore it:
       18  The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
       19  Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
  Direction: Exeunt
