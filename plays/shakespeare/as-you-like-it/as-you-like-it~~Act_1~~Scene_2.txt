          As You Like It : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.
  Direction: Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
    CELIA
        1  I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
    ROSALIND
        2  Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
        3  and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
        4  teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
        5  learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
    CELIA
        6  Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
        7  that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
        8  had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
        9  hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
       10  love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
       11  if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
       12  tempered as mine is to thee.
    ROSALIND
       13  Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
       14  rejoice in yours.
    CELIA
       15  You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
       16  like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
       17  be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
       18  father perforce, I will render thee again in
       19  affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
       20  that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
       21  sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
    ROSALIND
       22  From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
       23  me see; what think you of falling in love?
    CELIA
       24  Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
       25  love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
       26  neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
       27  in honour come off again.
    ROSALIND
       28  What shall be our sport, then?
    CELIA
       29  Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
       30  her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
    ROSALIND
       31  I would we could do so, for her benefits are
       32  mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
       33  doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
    CELIA
       34  'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
       35  makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
       36  makes very ill-favouredly.
    ROSALIND
       37  Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
       38  Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
       39  not in the lineaments of Nature.
  Direction: Enter TOUCHSTONE
    CELIA
       40  No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
       41  not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
       42  hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
       43  Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
    ROSALIND
       44  Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
       45  Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
       46  Nature's wit.
    CELIA
       47  Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
       48  Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
       49  to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
       50  natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
       51  the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
       52  wit! whither wander you?
    TOUCHSTONE
       53  Mistress, you must come away to your father.
    CELIA
       54  Were you made the messenger?
    TOUCHSTONE
       55  No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.
    ROSALIND
       56  Where learned you that oath, fool?
    TOUCHSTONE
       57  Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
       58  were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
       59  mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
       60  pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
       61  yet was not the knight forsworn.
    CELIA
       62  How prove you that, in the great heap of your
       63  knowledge?
    ROSALIND
       64  Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
    TOUCHSTONE
       65  Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
       66  swear by your beards that I am a knave.
    CELIA
       67  By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
    TOUCHSTONE
       68  By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
       69  swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
       70  more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
       71  never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
       72  before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
    CELIA
       73  Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?
    TOUCHSTONE
       74  One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
    CELIA
       75  My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
       76  speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
       77  one of these days.
    TOUCHSTONE
       78  The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
       79  wise men do foolishly.
    CELIA
       80  By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
       81  wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
       82  that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
       83  Monsieur Le Beau.
    ROSALIND
       84  With his mouth full of news.
    CELIA
       85  Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.
    ROSALIND
       86  Then shall we be news-crammed.
    CELIA
       87  All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
  Direction: Enter LE BEAU
       88  Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?
    LE BEAU
       89  Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
    CELIA
       90  Sport! of what colour?
    LE BEAU
       91  What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?
    ROSALIND
       92  As wit and fortune will.
    TOUCHSTONE
       93  Or as the Destinies decree.
    CELIA
       94  Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
    TOUCHSTONE
       95  Nay, if I keep not my rank,--
    ROSALIND
       96  Thou losest thy old smell.
    LE BEAU
       97  You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
       98  wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
    ROSALIND
       99  You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
    LE BEAU
      100  I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
      101  your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
      102  yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
      103  to perform it.
    CELIA
      104  Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
    LE BEAU
      105  There comes an old man and his three sons,--
    CELIA
      106  I could match this beginning with an old tale.
    LE BEAU
      107  Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
    ROSALIND
      108  With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
      109  by these presents.'
    LE BEAU
      110  The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
      111  duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
      112  and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
      113  hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
      114  so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
      115  their father, making such pitiful dole over them
      116  that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
    ROSALIND
      117  Alas!
    TOUCHSTONE
      118  But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
      119  have lost?
    LE BEAU
      120  Why, this that I speak of.
    TOUCHSTONE
      121  Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
      122  time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
      123  for ladies.
    CELIA
      124  Or I, I promise thee.
    ROSALIND
      125  But is there any else longs to see this broken music
      126  in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
      127  rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
    LE BEAU
      128  You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
      129  appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
      130  perform it.
    CELIA
      131  Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.
  Direction: Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants
    DUKE FREDERICK
      132  Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
      133  own peril on his forwardness.
    ROSALIND
      134  Is yonder the man?
    LE BEAU
      135  Even he, madam.
    CELIA
      136  Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.
    DUKE FREDERICK
      137  How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
      138  to see the wrestling?
    ROSALIND
      139  Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
    DUKE FREDERICK
      140  You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
      141  there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
      142  challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
      143  will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
      144  you can move him.
    CELIA
      145  Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
    DUKE FREDERICK
      146  Do so: I'll not be by.
    LE BEAU
      147  Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.
    ORLANDO
      148  I attend them with all respect and duty.
    ROSALIND
      149  Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?
    ORLANDO
      150  No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
      151  come but in, as others do, to try with him the
      152  strength of my youth.
    CELIA
      153  Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
      154  years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
      155  strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
      156  knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
      157  adventure would counsel you to a more equal
      158  enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
      159  embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
    ROSALIND
      160  Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
      161  be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
      162  that the wrestling might not go forward.
    ORLANDO
      163  I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
      164  thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
      165  so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
      166  your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
      167  trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
      168  shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
      169  dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
      170  friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
      171  world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
      172  the world I fill up a place, which may be better
      173  supplied when I have made it empty.
    ROSALIND
      174  The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
    CELIA
      175  And mine, to eke out hers.
    ROSALIND
      176  Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
    CELIA
      177  Your heart's desires be with you!
    CHARLES
      178  Come, where is this young gallant that is so
      179  desirous to lie with his mother earth?
    ORLANDO
      180  Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
    DUKE FREDERICK
      181  You shall try but one fall.
    CHARLES
      182  No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
      183  to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
      184  from a first.
    ORLANDO
      185  An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
      186  mocked me before: but come your ways.
    ROSALIND
      187  Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!
    CELIA
      188  I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
      189  fellow by the leg.
  Direction: They wrestle
    ROSALIND
      190  O excellent young man!
    CELIA
      191  If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
      192  should down.
  Direction: Shout. CHARLES is thrown
    DUKE FREDERICK
      193  No more, no more.
    ORLANDO
      194  Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.
    DUKE FREDERICK
      195  How dost thou, Charles?
    LE BEAU
      196  He cannot speak, my lord.
    DUKE FREDERICK
      197  Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
    ORLANDO
      198  Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
    DUKE FREDERICK
      199  I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
      200  The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
      201  But I did find him still mine enemy:
      202  Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
      203  Hadst thou descended from another house.
      204  But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
      205  I would thou hadst told me of another father.
  Direction: Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU
    CELIA
      206  Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
    ORLANDO
      207  I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
      208  His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
      209  To be adopted heir to Frederick.
    ROSALIND
      210  My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
      211  And all the world was of my father's mind:
      212  Had I before known this young man his son,
      213  I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
      214  Ere he should thus have ventured.
    CELIA
      215  Gentle cousin,
      216  Let us go thank him and encourage him:
      217  My father's rough and envious disposition
      218  Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
      219  If you do keep your promises in love
      220  But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
      221  Your mistress shall be happy.
    ROSALIND
      222  Gentleman,
  Direction: Giving him a chain from her neck
      223  Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
      224  That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
      225  Shall we go, coz?
    CELIA
      226  Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
    ORLANDO
      227  Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
      228  Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
      229  Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
    ROSALIND
      230  He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
      231  I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
      232  Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
      233  More than your enemies.
    CELIA
      234  Will you go, coz?
    ROSALIND
      235  Have with you. Fare you well.
  Direction: Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
    ORLANDO
      236  What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
      237  I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
      238  O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
      239  Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
  Direction: Re-enter LE BEAU
    LE BEAU
      240  Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
      241  To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
      242  High commendation, true applause and love,
      243  Yet such is now the duke's condition
      244  That he misconstrues all that you have done.
      245  The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
      246  More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
    ORLANDO
      247  I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
      248  Which of the two was daughter of the duke
      249  That here was at the wrestling?
    LE BEAU
      250  Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
      251  But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
      252  The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
      253  And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
      254  To keep his daughter company; whose loves
      255  Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
      256  But I can tell you that of late this duke
      257  Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
      258  Grounded upon no other argument
      259  But that the people praise her for her virtues
      260  And pity her for her good father's sake;
      261  And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
      262  Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
      263  Hereafter, in a better world than this,
      264  I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
    ORLANDO
      265  I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
  Direction: Exit LE BEAU
      266  Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
      267  From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
      268  But heavenly Rosalind!
  Direction: Exit
