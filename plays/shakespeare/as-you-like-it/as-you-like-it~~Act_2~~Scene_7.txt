          As You Like It : Act 2 : Scene 7

SCENE VII. The forest.
  Direction: A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and Lords like outlaws
    DUKE SENIOR
        1  I think he be transform'd into a beast;
        2  For I can no where find him like a man.
    First Lord
        3  My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
        4  Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
    DUKE SENIOR
        5  If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
        6  We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
        7  Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.
  Direction: Enter JAQUES
    First Lord
        8  He saves my labour by his own approach.
    DUKE SENIOR
        9  Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
       10  That your poor friends must woo your company?
       11  What, you look merrily!
    JAQUES
       12  A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
       13  A motley fool; a miserable world!
       14  As I do live by food, I met a fool
       15  Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
       16  And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
       17  In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
       18  'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
       19  'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
       20  And then he drew a dial from his poke,
       21  And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
       22  Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
       23  Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
       24  'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
       25  And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
       26  And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
       27  And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
       28  And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
       29  The motley fool thus moral on the time,
       30  My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
       31  That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
       32  And I did laugh sans intermission
       33  An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
       34  A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
    DUKE SENIOR
       35  What fool is this?
    JAQUES
       36  O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
       37  And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
       38  They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
       39  Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
       40  After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
       41  With observation, the which he vents
       42  In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
       43  I am ambitious for a motley coat.
    DUKE SENIOR
       44  Thou shalt have one.
    JAQUES
       45  It is my only suit;
       46  Provided that you weed your better judgments
       47  Of all opinion that grows rank in them
       48  That I am wise. I must have liberty
       49  Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
       50  To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
       51  And they that are most galled with my folly,
       52  They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
       53  The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
       54  He that a fool doth very wisely hit
       55  Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
       56  Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
       57  The wise man's folly is anatomized
       58  Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
       59  Invest me in my motley; give me leave
       60  To speak my mind, and I will through and through
       61  Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
       62  If they will patiently receive my medicine.
    DUKE SENIOR
       63  Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
    JAQUES
       64  What, for a counter, would I do but good?
    DUKE SENIOR
       65  Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
       66  For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
       67  As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
       68  And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
       69  That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
       70  Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
    JAQUES
       71  Why, who cries out on pride,
       72  That can therein tax any private party?
       73  Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
       74  Till that the weary very means do ebb?
       75  What woman in the city do I name,
       76  When that I say the city-woman bears
       77  The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
       78  Who can come in and say that I mean her,
       79  When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
       80  Or what is he of basest function
       81  That says his bravery is not of my cost,
       82  Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
       83  His folly to the mettle of my speech?
       84  There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
       85  My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
       86  Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
       87  Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
       88  Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
  Direction: Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn
    ORLANDO
       89  Forbear, and eat no more.
    JAQUES
       90  Why, I have eat none yet.
    ORLANDO
       91  Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.
    JAQUES
       92  Of what kind should this cock come of?
    DUKE SENIOR
       93  Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
       94  Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
       95  That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
    ORLANDO
       96  You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
       97  Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
       98  Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
       99  And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
      100  He dies that touches any of this fruit
      101  Till I and my affairs are answered.
    JAQUES
      102  An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
    DUKE SENIOR
      103  What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
      104  More than your force move us to gentleness.
    ORLANDO
      105  I almost die for food; and let me have it.
    DUKE SENIOR
      106  Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
    ORLANDO
      107  Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
      108  I thought that all things had been savage here;
      109  And therefore put I on the countenance
      110  Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
      111  That in this desert inaccessible,
      112  Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
      113  Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
      114  If ever you have look'd on better days,
      115  If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
      116  If ever sat at any good man's feast,
      117  If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
      118  And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
      119  Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
      120  In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
    DUKE SENIOR
      121  True is it that we have seen better days,
      122  And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
      123  And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
      124  Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
      125  And therefore sit you down in gentleness
      126  And take upon command what help we have
      127  That to your wanting may be minister'd.
    ORLANDO
      128  Then but forbear your food a little while,
      129  Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
      130  And give it food. There is an old poor man,
      131  Who after me hath many a weary step
      132  Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
      133  Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
      134  I will not touch a bit.
    DUKE SENIOR
      135  Go find him out,
      136  And we will nothing waste till you return.
    ORLANDO
      137  I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
  Direction: Exit
    DUKE SENIOR
      138  Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
      139  This wide and universal theatre
      140  Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
      141  Wherein we play in.
    JAQUES
      142  All the world's a stage,
      143  And all the men and women merely players:
      144  They have their exits and their entrances;
      145  And one man in his time plays many parts,
      146  His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
      147  Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
      148  And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
      149  And shining morning face, creeping like snail
      150  Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
      151  Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
      152  Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
      153  Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
      154  Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
      155  Seeking the bubble reputation
      156  Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
      157  In fair round belly with good capon lined,
      158  With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
      159  Full of wise saws and modern instances;
      160  And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
      161  Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
      162  With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
      163  His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
      164  For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
      165  Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
      166  And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
      167  That ends this strange eventful history,
      168  Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
      169  Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
  Direction: Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM
    DUKE SENIOR
      170  Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
      171  And let him feed.
    ORLANDO
      172  I thank you most for him.
    ADAM
      173  So had you need:
      174  I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
    DUKE SENIOR
      175  Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
      176  As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
      177  Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
      178  SONG.
    AMIENS
      179  Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
      180  Thou art not so unkind
      181  As man's ingratitude;
      182  Thy tooth is not so keen,
      183  Because thou art not seen,
      184  Although thy breath be rude.
      185  Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
      186  Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
      187  Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
      188  This life is most jolly.
      189  Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
      190  That dost not bite so nigh
      191  As benefits forgot:
      192  Though thou the waters warp,
      193  Thy sting is not so sharp
      194  As friend remember'd not.
      195  Heigh-ho! sing, and c.
    DUKE SENIOR
      196  If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
      197  As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
      198  And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
      199  Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
      200  Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
      201  That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
      202  Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
      203  Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
      204  Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
      205  And let me all your fortunes understand.
  Direction: Exeunt
