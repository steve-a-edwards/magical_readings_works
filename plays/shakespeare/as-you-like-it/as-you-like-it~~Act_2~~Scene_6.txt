          As You Like It : Act 2 : Scene 6

SCENE VI. The forest.
  Direction: Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
    ADAM
        1  Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!
        2  Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
        3  kind master.
    ORLANDO
        4  Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live
        5  a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
        6  If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I
        7  will either be food for it or bring it for food to
        8  thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
        9  For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at
       10  the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;
       11  and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
       12  give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
       13  come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
       14  thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.
       15  Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
       16  thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for
       17  lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this
       18  desert. Cheerly, good Adam!
  Direction: Exeunt
