          As You Like It : Act 4 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The forest.
  Direction: Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
    ROSALIND
        1  How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and
        2  here much Orlando!
    CELIA
        3  I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
        4  hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
        5  sleep. Look, who comes here.
  Direction: Enter SILVIUS
    SILVIUS
        6  My errand is to you, fair youth;
        7  My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
        8  I know not the contents; but, as I guess
        9  By the stern brow and waspish action
       10  Which she did use as she was writing of it,
       11  It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
       12  I am but as a guiltless messenger.
    ROSALIND
       13  Patience herself would startle at this letter
       14  And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
       15  She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
       16  She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
       17  Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
       18  Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
       19  Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
       20  This is a letter of your own device.
    SILVIUS
       21  No, I protest, I know not the contents:
       22  Phebe did write it.
    ROSALIND
       23  Come, come, you are a fool
       24  And turn'd into the extremity of love.
       25  I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
       26  A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
       27  That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
       28  She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
       29  I say she never did invent this letter;
       30  This is a man's invention and his hand.
    SILVIUS
       31  Sure, it is hers.
    ROSALIND
       32  Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
       33  A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
       34  Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
       35  Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
       36  Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
       37  Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
    SILVIUS
       38  So please you, for I never heard it yet;
       39  Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
    ROSALIND
       40  She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
  Direction: Reads
       41  Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
       42  That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
       43  Can a woman rail thus?
    SILVIUS
       44  Call you this railing?
    ROSALIND
       45  [Reads]
       46  Why, thy godhead laid apart,
       47  Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
       48  Did you ever hear such railing?
       49  Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
       50  That could do no vengeance to me.
       51  Meaning me a beast.
       52  If the scorn of your bright eyne
       53  Have power to raise such love in mine,
       54  Alack, in me what strange effect
       55  Would they work in mild aspect!
       56  Whiles you chid me, I did love;
       57  How then might your prayers move!
       58  He that brings this love to thee
       59  Little knows this love in me:
       60  And by him seal up thy mind;
       61  Whether that thy youth and kind
       62  Will the faithful offer take
       63  Of me and all that I can make;
       64  Or else by him my love deny,
       65  And then I'll study how to die.
    SILVIUS
       66  Call you this chiding?
    CELIA
       67  Alas, poor shepherd!
    ROSALIND
       68  Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt
       69  thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
       70  instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
       71  be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
       72  love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
       73  her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
       74  thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless
       75  thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
       76  hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.
  Direction: Exit SILVIUS
  Direction: Enter OLIVER
    OLIVER
       77  Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,
       78  Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
       79  A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?
    CELIA
       80  West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:
       81  The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
       82  Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
       83  But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
       84  There's none within.
    OLIVER
       85  If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
       86  Then should I know you by description;
       87  Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,
       88  Of female favour, and bestows himself
       89  Like a ripe sister: the woman low
       90  And browner than her brother.' Are not you
       91  The owner of the house I did inquire for?
    CELIA
       92  It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
    OLIVER
       93  Orlando doth commend him to you both,
       94  And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
       95  He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
    ROSALIND
       96  I am: what must we understand by this?
    OLIVER
       97  Some of my shame; if you will know of me
       98  What man I am, and how, and why, and where
       99  This handkercher was stain'd.
    CELIA
      100  I pray you, tell it.
    OLIVER
      101  When last the young Orlando parted from you
      102  He left a promise to return again
      103  Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
      104  Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
      105  Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
      106  And mark what object did present itself:
      107  Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
      108  And high top bald with dry antiquity,
      109  A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
      110  Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
      111  A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
      112  Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
      113  The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
      114  Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
      115  And with indented glides did slip away
      116  Into a bush: under which bush's shade
      117  A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
      118  Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
      119  When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
      120  The royal disposition of that beast
      121  To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
      122  This seen, Orlando did approach the man
      123  And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
    CELIA
      124  O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
      125  And he did render him the most unnatural
      126  That lived amongst men.
    OLIVER
      127  And well he might so do,
      128  For well I know he was unnatural.
    ROSALIND
      129  But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
      130  Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
    OLIVER
      131  Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
      132  But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
      133  And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
      134  Made him give battle to the lioness,
      135  Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
      136  From miserable slumber I awaked.
    CELIA
      137  Are you his brother?
    ROSALIND
      138  Wast you he rescued?
    CELIA
      139  Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
    OLIVER
      140  'Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shame
      141  To tell you what I was, since my conversion
      142  So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
    ROSALIND
      143  But, for the bloody napkin?
    OLIVER
      144  By and by.
      145  When from the first to last betwixt us two
      146  Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
      147  As how I came into that desert place:--
      148  In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
      149  Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
      150  Committing me unto my brother's love;
      151  Who led me instantly unto his cave,
      152  There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
      153  The lioness had torn some flesh away,
      154  Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
      155  And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
      156  Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;
      157  And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
      158  He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
      159  To tell this story, that you might excuse
      160  His broken promise, and to give this napkin
      161  Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
      162  That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
  Direction: ROSALIND swoons
    CELIA
      163  Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
    OLIVER
      164  Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
    CELIA
      165  There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
    OLIVER
      166  Look, he recovers.
    ROSALIND
      167  I would I were at home.
    CELIA
      168  We'll lead you thither.
      169  I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
    OLIVER
      170  Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a
      171  man's heart.
    ROSALIND
      172  I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would
      173  think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell
      174  your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
    OLIVER
      175  This was not counterfeit: there is too great
      176  testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
      177  of earnest.
    ROSALIND
      178  Counterfeit, I assure you.
    OLIVER
      179  Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
    ROSALIND
      180  So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.
    CELIA
      181  Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw
      182  homewards. Good sir, go with us.
    OLIVER
      183  That will I, for I must bear answer back
      184  How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
    ROSALIND
      185  I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend
      186  my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?
  Direction: Exeunt
