          As You Like It : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. The forest.
  Direction: Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
    TOUCHSTONE
        1  We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
    AUDREY
        2  Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
        3  gentleman's saying.
    TOUCHSTONE
        4  A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile
        5  Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the
        6  forest lays claim to you.
    AUDREY
        7  Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in
        8  the world: here comes the man you mean.
    TOUCHSTONE
        9  It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my
       10  troth, we that have good wits have much to answer
       11  for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.
  Direction: Enter WILLIAM
    WILLIAM
       12  Good even, Audrey.
    AUDREY
       13  God ye good even, William.
    WILLIAM
       14  And good even to you, sir.
    TOUCHSTONE
       15  Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
       16  head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?
    WILLIAM
       17  Five and twenty, sir.
    TOUCHSTONE
       18  A ripe age. Is thy name William?
    WILLIAM
       19  William, sir.
    TOUCHSTONE
       20  A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?
    WILLIAM
       21  Ay, sir, I thank God.
    TOUCHSTONE
       22  'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?
    WILLIAM
       23  Faith, sir, so so.
    TOUCHSTONE
       24  'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
       25  yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
    WILLIAM
       26  Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
    TOUCHSTONE
       27  Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,
       28  'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man
       29  knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen
       30  philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
       31  would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;
       32  meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
       33  lips to open. You do love this maid?
    WILLIAM
       34  I do, sir.
    TOUCHSTONE
       35  Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
    WILLIAM
       36  No, sir.
    TOUCHSTONE
       37  Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it
       38  is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out
       39  of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty
       40  the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse
       41  is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
    WILLIAM
       42  Which he, sir?
    TOUCHSTONE
       43  He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
       44  clown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--the
       45  society,--which in the boorish is company,--of this
       46  female,--which in the common is woman; which
       47  together is, abandon the society of this female, or,
       48  clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better
       49  understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make
       50  thee away, translate thy life into death, thy
       51  liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with
       52  thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy
       53  with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with
       54  policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:
       55  therefore tremble and depart.
    AUDREY
       56  Do, good William.
    WILLIAM
       57  God rest you merry, sir.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter CORIN
    CORIN
       58  Our master and mistress seeks you; come, away, away!
    TOUCHSTONE
       59  Trip, Audrey! trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend.
  Direction: Exeunt
