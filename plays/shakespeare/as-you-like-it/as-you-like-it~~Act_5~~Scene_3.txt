SCENE III. The forest.
  Direction: Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
    TOUCHSTONE
        1  To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will
        2  we be married.
    AUDREY
        3  I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is
        4  no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the
        5  world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.
  Direction: Enter two Pages
    First Page
        6  Well met, honest gentleman.
    TOUCHSTONE
        7  By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.
    Second Page
        8  We are for you: sit i' the middle.
    First Page
        9  Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or
       10  spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only
       11  prologues to a bad voice?
    Second Page
       12  I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two
       13  gipsies on a horse.
       14  SONG.
       15  It was a lover and his lass,
       16  With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
       17  That o'er the green corn-field did pass
       18  In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
       19  When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:
       20  Sweet lovers love the spring.
       21  Between the acres of the rye,
       22  With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino
       23  These pretty country folks would lie,
       24  In spring time, and c.
       25  This carol they began that hour,
       26  With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
       27  How that a life was but a flower
       28  In spring time, and c.
       29  And therefore take the present time,
       30  With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;
       31  For love is crowned with the prime
       32  In spring time, and c.
    TOUCHSTONE
       33  Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
       34  matter in the ditty, yet the note was very
       35  untuneable.
    First Page
       36  You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.
    TOUCHSTONE
       37  By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear
       38  such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend
       39  your voices! Come, Audrey.
  Direction: Exeunt
