          As You Like It : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A room in the palace.
  Direction: Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER
    DUKE FREDERICK
        1  Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
        2  But were I not the better part made mercy,
        3  I should not seek an absent argument
        4  Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
        5  Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;
        6  Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
        7  Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
        8  To seek a living in our territory.
        9  Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
       10  Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
       11  Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
       12  Of what we think against thee.
    OLIVER
       13  O that your highness knew my heart in this!
       14  I never loved my brother in my life.
    DUKE FREDERICK
       15  More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
       16  And let my officers of such a nature
       17  Make an extent upon his house and lands:
       18  Do this expediently and turn him going.
  Direction: Exeunt
