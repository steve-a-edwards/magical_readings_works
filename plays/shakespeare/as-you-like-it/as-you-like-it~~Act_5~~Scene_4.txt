          As You Like It : Act 5 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. The forest.
  Direction: Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA
    DUKE SENIOR
        1  Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
        2  Can do all this that he hath promised?
    ORLANDO
        3  I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;
        4  As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
  Direction: Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE
    ROSALIND
        5  Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:
        6  You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
        7  You will bestow her on Orlando here?
    DUKE SENIOR
        8  That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
    ROSALIND
        9  And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?
    ORLANDO
       10  That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
    ROSALIND
       11  You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?
    PHEBE
       12  That will I, should I die the hour after.
    ROSALIND
       13  But if you do refuse to marry me,
       14  You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
    PHEBE
       15  So is the bargain.
    ROSALIND
       16  You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
    SILVIUS
       17  Though to have her and death were both one thing.
    ROSALIND
       18  I have promised to make all this matter even.
       19  Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;
       20  You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
       21  Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
       22  Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
       23  Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.
       24  If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
       25  To make these doubts all even.
  Direction: Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
    DUKE SENIOR
       26  I do remember in this shepherd boy
       27  Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
    ORLANDO
       28  My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
       29  Methought he was a brother to your daughter:
       30  But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
       31  And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
       32  Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
       33  Whom he reports to be a great magician,
       34  Obscured in the circle of this forest.
  Direction: Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
    JAQUES
       35  There is, sure, another flood toward, and these
       36  couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
       37  very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.
    TOUCHSTONE
       38  Salutation and greeting to you all!
    JAQUES
       39  Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
       40  motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
       41  the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.
    TOUCHSTONE
       42  If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
       43  purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
       44  a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth
       45  with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
       46  had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.
    JAQUES
       47  And how was that ta'en up?
    TOUCHSTONE
       48  Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
       49  seventh cause.
    JAQUES
       50  How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
    DUKE SENIOR
       51  I like him very well.
    TOUCHSTONE
       52  God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I
       53  press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
       54  copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
       55  marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
       56  sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
       57  humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
       58  will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
       59  poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.
    DUKE SENIOR
       60  By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
    TOUCHSTONE
       61  According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
    JAQUES
       62  But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the
       63  quarrel on the seventh cause?
    TOUCHSTONE
       64  Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
       65  seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the
       66  cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
       67  if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
       68  mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
       69  If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
       70  would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
       71  this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
       72  not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
       73  called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
       74  well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
       75  is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
       76  well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
       77  Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
       78  Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
    JAQUES
       79  And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
    TOUCHSTONE
       80  I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
       81  nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
       82  measured swords and parted.
    JAQUES
       83  Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
    TOUCHSTONE
       84  O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have
       85  books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
       86  The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
       87  Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
       88  fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
       89  Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
       90  Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
       91  these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
       92  avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
       93  justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
       94  parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
       95  of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and
       96  they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
       97  only peacemaker; much virtue in If.
    JAQUES
       98  Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at
       99  any thing and yet a fool.
    DUKE SENIOR
      100  He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
      101  the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
  Direction: Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA
  Direction: Still Music
    HYMEN
      102  Then is there mirth in heaven,
      103  When earthly things made even
      104  Atone together.
      105  Good duke, receive thy daughter
      106  Hymen from heaven brought her,
      107  Yea, brought her hither,
      108  That thou mightst join her hand with his
      109  Whose heart within his bosom is.
    ROSALIND
      110  [To DUKE SENIOR] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
  Direction: To ORLANDO
      111  To you I give myself, for I am yours.
    DUKE SENIOR
      112  If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
    ORLANDO
      113  If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
    PHEBE
      114  If sight and shape be true,
      115  Why then, my love adieu!
    ROSALIND
      116  I'll have no father, if you be not he:
      117  I'll have no husband, if you be not he:
      118  Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
    HYMEN
      119  Peace, ho! I bar confusion:
      120  'Tis I must make conclusion
      121  Of these most strange events:
      122  Here's eight that must take hands
      123  To join in Hymen's bands,
      124  If truth holds true contents.
      125  You and you no cross shall part:
      126  You and you are heart in heart
      127  You to his love must accord,
      128  Or have a woman to your lord:
      129  You and you are sure together,
      130  As the winter to foul weather.
      131  Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
      132  Feed yourselves with questioning;
      133  That reason wonder may diminish,
      134  How thus we met, and these things finish.
      135  SONG.
      136  Wedding is great Juno's crown:
      137  O blessed bond of board and bed!
      138  'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
      139  High wedlock then be honoured:
      140  Honour, high honour and renown,
      141  To Hymen, god of every town!
    DUKE SENIOR
      142  O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
      143  Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.
    PHEBE
      144  I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
      145  Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
  Direction: Enter JAQUES DE BOYS
    JAQUES DE BOYS
      146  Let me have audience for a word or two:
      147  I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
      148  That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
      149  Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
      150  Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
      151  Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
      152  In his own conduct, purposely to take
      153  His brother here and put him to the sword:
      154  And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
      155  Where meeting with an old religious man,
      156  After some question with him, was converted
      157  Both from his enterprise and from the world,
      158  His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
      159  And all their lands restored to them again
      160  That were with him exiled. This to be true,
      161  I do engage my life.
    DUKE SENIOR
      162  Welcome, young man;
      163  Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
      164  To one his lands withheld, and to the other
      165  A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
      166  First, in this forest, let us do those ends
      167  That here were well begun and well begot:
      168  And after, every of this happy number
      169  That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
      170  Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
      171  According to the measure of their states.
      172  Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
      173  And fall into our rustic revelry.
      174  Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
      175  With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.
    JAQUES
      176  Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
      177  The duke hath put on a religious life
      178  And thrown into neglect the pompous court?
    JAQUES DE BOYS
      179  He hath.
    JAQUES
      180  To him will I : out of these convertites
      181  There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
  Direction: To DUKE SENIOR
      182  You to your former honour I bequeath;
      183  Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:
  Direction: To ORLANDO
      184  You to a love that your true faith doth merit:
  Direction: To OLIVER
      185  You to your land and love and great allies:
  Direction: To SILVIUS
      186  You to a long and well-deserved bed:
  Direction: To TOUCHSTONE
      187  And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
      188  Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:
      189  I am for other than for dancing measures.
    DUKE SENIOR
      190  Stay, Jaques, stay.
    JAQUES
      191  To see no pastime I what you would have
      192  I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.
  Direction: Exit
    DUKE SENIOR
      193  Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
      194  As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.
  Direction: A dance
      195  EPILOGUE
    ROSALIND
      196  It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;
      197  but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
      198  the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
      199  no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no
      200  epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
      201  and good plays prove the better by the help of good
      202  epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am
      203  neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
      204  you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
      205  furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
      206  become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin
      207  with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
      208  you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
      209  please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love
      210  you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,
      211  none of you hates them--that between you and the
      212  women the play may please. If I were a woman I
      213  would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
      214  me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I
      215  defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good
      216  beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my
      217  kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
  Direction: Exeunt
