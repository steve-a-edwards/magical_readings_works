          As You Like It : Act 2 : Scene 5

SCENE V. The Forest.
  Direction: Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and others. Sings.
    AMIENS
        1  Under the greenwood tree
        2  Who loves to lie with me,
        3  And turn his merry note
        4  Unto the sweet bird's throat,
        5  Come hither, come hither, come hither:
        6  Here shall he see No enemy
        7  But winter and rough weather.
    JAQUES
        8  More, more, I prithee, more.
    AMIENS
        9  It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
    JAQUES
       10  I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
       11  melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
       12  More, I prithee, more.
    AMIENS
       13  My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.
    JAQUES
       14  I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to
       15  sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?
    AMIENS
       16  What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
    JAQUES
       17  Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me
       18  nothing. Will you sing?
    AMIENS
       19  More at your request than to please myself.
    JAQUES
       20  Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;
       21  but that they call compliment is like the encounter
       22  of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
       23  methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
       24  the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will
       25  not, hold your tongues.
    AMIENS
       26  Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the
       27  duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
       28  this day to look you.
    JAQUES
       29  And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
       30  too disputable for my company: I think of as many
       31  matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
       32  boast of them. Come, warble, come.
       33  SONG.
       34  Who doth ambition shun
  Direction: All together here
       35  And loves to live i' the sun,
       36  Seeking the food he eats
       37  And pleased with what he gets,
       38  Come hither, come hither, come hither:
       39  Here shall he see No enemy
       40  But winter and rough weather.
    JAQUES
       41  I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
       42  yesterday in despite of my invention.
    AMIENS
       43  And I'll sing it.
    JAQUES
       44  Thus it goes:--
       45  If it do come to pass
       46  That any man turn ass,
       47  Leaving his wealth and ease,
       48  A stubborn will to please,
       49  Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
       50  Here shall he see
       51  Gross fools as he,
       52  An if he will come to me.
    AMIENS
       53  What's that 'ducdame'?
    JAQUES
       54  'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
       55  circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll
       56  rail against all the first-born of Egypt.
    AMIENS
       57  And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.
  Direction: Exeunt severally
