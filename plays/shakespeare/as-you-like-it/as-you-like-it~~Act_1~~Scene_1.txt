          As You Like It : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.
  Direction: Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
    ORLANDO
        1  As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
        2  bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
        3  and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
        4  blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
        5  sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
        6  report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
        7  he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
        8  properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
        9  that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
       10  differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
       11  are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
       12  with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
       13  and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
       14  brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
       15  which his animals on his dunghills are as much
       16  bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
       17  plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
       18  me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
       19  me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
       20  brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
       21  gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
       22  grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
       23  think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
       24  servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
       25  know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
    ADAM
       26  Yonder comes my master, your brother.
    ORLANDO
       27  Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
       28  shake me up.
  Direction: Enter OLIVER
    OLIVER
       29  Now, sir! what make you here?
    ORLANDO
       30  Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
    OLIVER
       31  What mar you then, sir?
    ORLANDO
       32  Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
       33  made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
    OLIVER
       34  Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
    ORLANDO
       35  Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
       36  What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
       37  come to such penury?
    OLIVER
       38  Know you where your are, sir?
    ORLANDO
       39  O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
    OLIVER
       40  Know you before whom, sir?
    ORLANDO
       41  Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
       42  you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
       43  condition of blood, you should so know me. The
       44  courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
       45  you are the first-born; but the same tradition
       46  takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
       47  betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
       48  you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
       49  nearer to his reverence.
    OLIVER
       50  What, boy!
    ORLANDO
       51  Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
    OLIVER
       52  Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
    ORLANDO
       53  I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
       54  Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
       55  a villain that says such a father begot villains.
       56  Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
       57  from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
       58  tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
    ADAM
       59  Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
       60  remembrance, be at accord.
    OLIVER
       61  Let me go, I say.
    ORLANDO
       62  I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
       63  father charged you in his will to give me good
       64  education: you have trained me like a peasant,
       65  obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
       66  qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
       67  me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
       68  me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
       69  give me the poor allottery my father left me by
       70  testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
    OLIVER
       71  And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
       72  Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
       73  with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
       74  pray you, leave me.
    ORLANDO
       75  I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
    OLIVER
       76  Get you with him, you old dog.
    ADAM
       77  Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
       78  teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
       79  he would not have spoke such a word.
  Direction: Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
    OLIVER
       80  Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
       81  physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
       82  crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!
  Direction: Enter DENNIS
    DENNIS
       83  Calls your worship?
    OLIVER
       84  Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
    DENNIS
       85  So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
       86  access to you.
    OLIVER
       87  Call him in.
  Direction: Exit DENNIS
       88  'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.
  Direction: Enter CHARLES
    CHARLES
       89  Good morrow to your worship.
    OLIVER
       90  Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
       91  new court?
    CHARLES
       92  There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
       93  that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
       94  brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
       95  have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
       96  whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
       97  therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
    OLIVER
       98  Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
       99  banished with her father?
    CHARLES
      100  O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
      101  her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
      102  that she would have followed her exile, or have died
      103  to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
      104  less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
      105  never two ladies loved as they do.
    OLIVER
      106  Where will the old duke live?
    CHARLES
      107  They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
      108  a many merry men with him; and there they live like
      109  the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
      110  gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
      111  carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
    OLIVER
      112  What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
    CHARLES
      113  Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
      114  matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
      115  that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
      116  to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
      117  To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
      118  escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
      119  well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
      120  for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
      121  must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
      122  out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
      123  withal, that either you might stay him from his
      124  intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
      125  run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
      126  and altogether against my will.
    OLIVER
      127  Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
      128  thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
      129  myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
      130  have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
      131  it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
      132  it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
      133  of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
      134  good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
      135  me his natural brother: therefore use thy
      136  discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
      137  as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
      138  thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
      139  mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
      140  against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
      141  treacherous device and never leave thee till he
      142  hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
      143  for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
      144  it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
      145  day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
      146  should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
      147  blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
    CHARLES
      148  I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
      149  to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
      150  alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
      151  so God keep your worship!
    OLIVER
      152  Farewell, good Charles.
  Direction: Exit CHARLES
      153  Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
      154  an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
      155  hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
      156  schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
      157  all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
      158  in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
      159  people, who best know him, that I am altogether
      160  misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
      161  wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
      162  I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.
  Direction: Exit
