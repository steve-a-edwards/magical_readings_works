          As You Like It : Act 3 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The forest.
  Direction: Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind
    TOUCHSTONE
        1  Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
        2  goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
        3  doth my simple feature content you?
    AUDREY
        4  Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!
    TOUCHSTONE
        5  I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
        6  capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
    JAQUES
        7  [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
        8  in a thatched house!
    TOUCHSTONE
        9  When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
       10  man's good wit seconded with the forward child
       11  Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
       12  great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
       13  the gods had made thee poetical.
    AUDREY
       14  I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
       15  deed and word? is it a true thing?
    TOUCHSTONE
       16  No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
       17  feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
       18  they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
    AUDREY
       19  Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
    TOUCHSTONE
       20  I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
       21  honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
       22  hope thou didst feign.
    AUDREY
       23  Would you not have me honest?
    TOUCHSTONE
       24  No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
       25  honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
    JAQUES
       26  [Aside] A material fool!
    AUDREY
       27  Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
       28  make me honest.
    TOUCHSTONE
       29  Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
       30  were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
    AUDREY
       31  I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
    TOUCHSTONE
       32  Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
       33  sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
       34  be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
       35  with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
       36  village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
       37  of the forest and to couple us.
    JAQUES
       38  [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
    AUDREY
       39  Well, the gods give us joy!
    TOUCHSTONE
       40  Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
       41  stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
       42  but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
       43  though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are
       44  necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
       45  his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
       46  knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
       47  his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
       48  Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
       49  hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
       50  therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
       51  worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
       52  married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
       53  bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
       54  skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
       55  want. Here comes Sir Oliver.
  Direction: Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
       56  Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you
       57  dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
       58  with you to your chapel?
    SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
       59  Is there none here to give the woman?
    TOUCHSTONE
       60  I will not take her on gift of any man.
    SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
       61  Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
    JAQUES
       62  [Advancing]
       63  Proceed, proceed I'll give her.
    TOUCHSTONE
       64  Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
       65  sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
       66  last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
       67  toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.
    JAQUES
       68  Will you be married, motley?
    TOUCHSTONE
       69  As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
       70  the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
       71  as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
    JAQUES
       72  And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
       73  married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
       74  church, and have a good priest that can tell you
       75  what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
       76  together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
       77  prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
    TOUCHSTONE
       78  [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
       79  married of him than of another: for he is not like
       80  to marry me well; and not being well married, it
       81  will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
    JAQUES
       82  Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
    TOUCHSTONE
       83  'Come, sweet Audrey:
       84  We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
       85  Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--
       86  O sweet Oliver,
       87  O brave Oliver,
       88  Leave me not behind thee: but,--
       89  Wind away,
       90  Begone, I say,
       91  I will not to wedding with thee.
  Direction: Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
    SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
       92  'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them
       93  all shall flout me out of my calling.
  Direction: Exit
