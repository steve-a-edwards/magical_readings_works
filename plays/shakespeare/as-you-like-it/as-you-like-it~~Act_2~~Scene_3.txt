          As You Like It : Act 2 : Scene 3

SCENE III. Before OLIVER'S house.
  Direction: Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting
    ORLANDO
        1  Who's there?
    ADAM
        2  What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
        3  O my sweet master! O you memory
        4  Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
        5  Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
        6  And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
        7  Why would you be so fond to overcome
        8  The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
        9  Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
       10  Know you not, master, to some kind of men
       11  Their graces serve them but as enemies?
       12  No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
       13  Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
       14  O, what a world is this, when what is comely
       15  Envenoms him that bears it!
    ORLANDO
       16  Why, what's the matter?
    ADAM
       17  O unhappy youth!
       18  Come not within these doors; within this roof
       19  The enemy of all your graces lives:
       20  Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
       21  Yet not the son, I will not call him son
       22  Of him I was about to call his father--
       23  Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
       24  To burn the lodging where you use to lie
       25  And you within it: if he fail of that,
       26  He will have other means to cut you off.
       27  I overheard him and his practises.
       28  This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
       29  Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
    ORLANDO
       30  Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
    ADAM
       31  No matter whither, so you come not here.
    ORLANDO
       32  What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
       33  Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
       34  A thievish living on the common road?
       35  This I must do, or know not what to do:
       36  Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
       37  I rather will subject me to the malice
       38  Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
    ADAM
       39  But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
       40  The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
       41  Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
       42  When service should in my old limbs lie lame
       43  And unregarded age in corners thrown:
       44  Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
       45  Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
       46  Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
       47  And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
       48  Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
       49  For in my youth I never did apply
       50  Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
       51  Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
       52  The means of weakness and debility;
       53  Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
       54  Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
       55  I'll do the service of a younger man
       56  In all your business and necessities.
    ORLANDO
       57  O good old man, how well in thee appears
       58  The constant service of the antique world,
       59  When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
       60  Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
       61  Where none will sweat but for promotion,
       62  And having that, do choke their service up
       63  Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
       64  But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
       65  That cannot so much as a blossom yield
       66  In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
       67  But come thy ways; well go along together,
       68  And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
       69  We'll light upon some settled low content.
    ADAM
       70  Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
       71  To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
       72  From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
       73  Here lived I, but now live here no more.
       74  At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
       75  But at fourscore it is too late a week:
       76  Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
       77  Than to die well and not my master's debtor.
  Direction: Exeunt
