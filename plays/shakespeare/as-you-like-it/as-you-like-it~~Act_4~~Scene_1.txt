          As You Like It : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. The forest.
  Direction: Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES
    JAQUES
        1  I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted
        2  with thee.
    ROSALIND
        3  They say you are a melancholy fellow.
    JAQUES
        4  I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
    ROSALIND
        5  Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
        6  fellows and betray themselves to every modern
        7  censure worse than drunkards.
    JAQUES
        8  Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
    ROSALIND
        9  Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
    JAQUES
       10  I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
       11  emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
       12  nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
       13  soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
       14  which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
       15  the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
       16  melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
       17  extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
       18  contemplation of my travels, in which my often
       19  rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.
    ROSALIND
       20  A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
       21  be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
       22  other men's; then, to have seen much and to have
       23  nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
    JAQUES
       24  Yes, I have gained my experience.
    ROSALIND
       25  And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
       26  a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
       27  sad; and to travel for it too!
  Direction: Enter ORLANDO
    ORLANDO
       28  Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!
    JAQUES
       29  Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.
  Direction: Exit
    ROSALIND
       30  Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
       31  wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
       32  own country, be out of love with your nativity and
       33  almost chide God for making you that countenance you
       34  are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
       35  gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
       36  all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
       37  another trick, never come in my sight more.
    ORLANDO
       38  My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
    ROSALIND
       39  Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
       40  divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
       41  a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
       42  affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
       43  hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
       44  him heart-whole.
    ORLANDO
       45  Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
    ROSALIND
       46  Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
       47  had as lief be wooed of a snail.
    ORLANDO
       48  Of a snail?
    ROSALIND
       49  Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
       50  carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
       51  I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
       52  his destiny with him.
    ORLANDO
       53  What's that?
    ROSALIND
       54  Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
       55  beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
       56  his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
    ORLANDO
       57  Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
    ROSALIND
       58  And I am your Rosalind.
    CELIA
       59  It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
       60  Rosalind of a better leer than you.
    ROSALIND
       61  Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
       62  humour and like enough to consent. What would you
       63  say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?
    ORLANDO
       64  I would kiss before I spoke.
    ROSALIND
       65  Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
       66  gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
       67  occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
       68  out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God
       69  warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
    ORLANDO
       70  How if the kiss be denied?
    ROSALIND
       71  Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
    ORLANDO
       72  Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
    ROSALIND
       73  Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
       74  I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
    ORLANDO
       75  What, of my suit?
    ROSALIND
       76  Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
       77  Am not I your Rosalind?
    ORLANDO
       78  I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
       79  talking of her.
    ROSALIND
       80  Well in her person I say I will not have you.
    ORLANDO
       81  Then in mine own person I die.
    ROSALIND
       82  No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
       83  almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
       84  there was not any man died in his own person,
       85  videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
       86  dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
       87  could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
       88  of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
       89  year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
       90  for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
       91  but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
       92  taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
       93  coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
       94  But these are all lies: men have died from time to
       95  time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
    ORLANDO
       96  I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
       97  for, I protest, her frown might kill me.
    ROSALIND
       98  By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
       99  I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
      100  disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
      101  it.
    ORLANDO
      102  Then love me, Rosalind.
    ROSALIND
      103  Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
    ORLANDO
      104  And wilt thou have me?
    ROSALIND
      105  Ay, and twenty such.
    ORLANDO
      106  What sayest thou?
    ROSALIND
      107  Are you not good?
    ORLANDO
      108  I hope so.
    ROSALIND
      109  Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
      110  Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
      111  Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?
    ORLANDO
      112  Pray thee, marry us.
    CELIA
      113  I cannot say the words.
    ROSALIND
      114  You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'
    CELIA
      115  Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
    ORLANDO
      116  I will.
    ROSALIND
      117  Ay, but when?
    ORLANDO
      118  Why now; as fast as she can marry us.
    ROSALIND
      119  Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
    ORLANDO
      120  I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
    ROSALIND
      121  I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
      122  thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
      123  before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
      124  runs before her actions.
    ORLANDO
      125  So do all thoughts; they are winged.
    ROSALIND
      126  Now tell me how long you would have her after you
      127  have possessed her.
    ORLANDO
      128  For ever and a day.
    ROSALIND
      129  Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
      130  men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
      131  maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
      132  changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
      133  of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
      134  more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
      135  new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
      136  than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
      137  in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
      138  disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
      139  that when thou art inclined to sleep.
    ORLANDO
      140  But will my Rosalind do so?
    ROSALIND
      141  By my life, she will do as I do.
    ORLANDO
      142  O, but she is wise.
    ROSALIND
      143  Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
      144  wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
      145  wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
      146  'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
      147  with the smoke out at the chimney.
    ORLANDO
      148  A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
      149  'Wit, whither wilt?'
    ROSALIND
      150  Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
      151  your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
    ORLANDO
      152  And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
    ROSALIND
      153  Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
      154  never take her without her answer, unless you take
      155  her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
      156  make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
      157  never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
      158  it like a fool!
    ORLANDO
      159  For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
    ROSALIND
      160  Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
    ORLANDO
      161  I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
      162  will be with thee again.
    ROSALIND
      163  Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you
      164  would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
      165  thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
      166  won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
      167  death! Two o'clock is your hour?
    ORLANDO
      168  Ay, sweet Rosalind.
    ROSALIND
      169  By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
      170  me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
      171  if you break one jot of your promise or come one
      172  minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
      173  pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
      174  and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
      175  may be chosen out of the gross band of the
      176  unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
      177  your promise.
    ORLANDO
      178  With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
      179  Rosalind: so adieu.
    ROSALIND
      180  Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
      181  offenders, and let Time try: adieu.
  Direction: Exit ORLANDO
    CELIA
      182  You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
      183  we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
      184  head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
      185  her own nest.
    ROSALIND
      186  O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
      187  didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
      188  it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
      189  bottom, like the bay of Portugal.
    CELIA
      190  Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
      191  affection in, it runs out.
    ROSALIND
      192  No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
      193  of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
      194  that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
      195  because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
      196  am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
      197  of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
      198  sigh till he come.
    CELIA
      199  And I'll sleep.
  Direction: Exeunt
