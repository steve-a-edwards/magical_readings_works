          As You Like It : Act 1 : Scene 3

SCENE III. A room in the palace.
  Direction: Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
    CELIA
        1  Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?
    ROSALIND
        2  Not one to throw at a dog.
    CELIA
        3  No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
        4  curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
    ROSALIND
        5  Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
        6  should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
        7  without any.
    CELIA
        8  But is all this for your father?
    ROSALIND
        9  No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
       10  full of briers is this working-day world!
    CELIA
       11  They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
       12  holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
       13  paths our very petticoats will catch them.
    ROSALIND
       14  I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
    CELIA
       15  Hem them away.
    ROSALIND
       16  I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
    CELIA
       17  Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
    ROSALIND
       18  O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!
    CELIA
       19  O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
       20  despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
       21  service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
       22  possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
       23  strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
    ROSALIND
       24  The duke my father loved his father dearly.
    CELIA
       25  Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
       26  dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
       27  for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
       28  not Orlando.
    ROSALIND
       29  No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
    CELIA
       30  Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
    ROSALIND
       31  Let me love him for that, and do you love him
       32  because I do. Look, here comes the duke.
    CELIA
       33  With his eyes full of anger.
  Direction: Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords
    DUKE FREDERICK
       34  Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
       35  And get you from our court.
    ROSALIND
       36  Me, uncle?
    DUKE FREDERICK
       37  You, cousin
       38  Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
       39  So near our public court as twenty miles,
       40  Thou diest for it.
    ROSALIND
       41  I do beseech your grace,
       42  Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
       43  If with myself I hold intelligence
       44  Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
       45  If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
       46  As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
       47  Never so much as in a thought unborn
       48  Did I offend your highness.
    DUKE FREDERICK
       49  Thus do all traitors:
       50  If their purgation did consist in words,
       51  They are as innocent as grace itself:
       52  Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
    ROSALIND
       53  Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
       54  Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
    DUKE FREDERICK
       55  Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
    ROSALIND
       56  So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
       57  So was I when your highness banish'd him:
       58  Treason is not inherited, my lord;
       59  Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
       60  What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
       61  Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
       62  To think my poverty is treacherous.
    CELIA
       63  Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
    DUKE FREDERICK
       64  Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
       65  Else had she with her father ranged along.
    CELIA
       66  I did not then entreat to have her stay;
       67  It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
       68  I was too young that time to value her;
       69  But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
       70  Why so am I; we still have slept together,
       71  Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
       72  And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
       73  Still we went coupled and inseparable.
    DUKE FREDERICK
       74  She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
       75  Her very silence and her patience
       76  Speak to the people, and they pity her.
       77  Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
       78  And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
       79  When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
       80  Firm and irrevocable is my doom
       81  Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
    CELIA
       82  Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
       83  I cannot live out of her company.
    DUKE FREDERICK
       84  You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
       85  If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
       86  And in the greatness of my word, you die.
  Direction: Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords
    CELIA
       87  O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
       88  Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
       89  I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
    ROSALIND
       90  I have more cause.
    CELIA
       91  Thou hast not, cousin;
       92  Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
       93  Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
    ROSALIND
       94  That he hath not.
    CELIA
       95  No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
       96  Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
       97  Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
       98  No: let my father seek another heir.
       99  Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
      100  Whither to go and what to bear with us;
      101  And do not seek to take your change upon you,
      102  To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
      103  For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
      104  Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
    ROSALIND
      105  Why, whither shall we go?
    CELIA
      106  To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
    ROSALIND
      107  Alas, what danger will it be to us,
      108  Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
      109  Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
    CELIA
      110  I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
      111  And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
      112  The like do you: so shall we pass along
      113  And never stir assailants.
    ROSALIND
      114  Were it not better,
      115  Because that I am more than common tall,
      116  That I did suit me all points like a man?
      117  A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
      118  A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
      119  Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
      120  We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
      121  As many other mannish cowards have
      122  That do outface it with their semblances.
    CELIA
      123  What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
    ROSALIND
      124  I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
      125  And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
      126  But what will you be call'd?
    CELIA
      127  Something that hath a reference to my state
      128  No longer Celia, but Aliena.
    ROSALIND
      129  But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
      130  The clownish fool out of your father's court?
      131  Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
    CELIA
      132  He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
      133  Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
      134  And get our jewels and our wealth together,
      135  Devise the fittest time and safest way
      136  To hide us from pursuit that will be made
      137  After my flight. Now go we in content
      138  To liberty and not to banishment.
  Direction: Exeunt
