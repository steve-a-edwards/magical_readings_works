          As You Like It : Act 3 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The forest.
  Direction: Enter ORLANDO, with a paper
    ORLANDO
        1  Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
        2  And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey
        3  With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
        4  Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
        5  O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
        6  And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;
        7  That every eye which in this forest looks
        8  Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
        9  Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree
       10  The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
    CORIN
       11  And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
    TOUCHSTONE
       12  Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
       13  life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,
       14  it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
       15  like it very well; but in respect that it is
       16  private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
       17  is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
       18  respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
       19  is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
       20  but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
       21  against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
    CORIN
       22  No more but that I know the more one sickens the
       23  worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
       24  means and content is without three good friends;
       25  that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
       26  burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
       27  great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
       28  he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
       29  complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
    TOUCHSTONE
       30  Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
       31  court, shepherd?
    CORIN
       32  No, truly.
    TOUCHSTONE
       33  Then thou art damned.
    CORIN
       34  Nay, I hope.
    TOUCHSTONE
       35  Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all
       36  on one side.
    CORIN
       37  For not being at court? Your reason.
    TOUCHSTONE
       38  Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
       39  good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
       40  then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
       41  sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
       42  state, shepherd.
    CORIN
       43  Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
       44  at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
       45  behavior of the country is most mockable at the
       46  court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
       47  you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
       48  uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.
    TOUCHSTONE
       49  Instance, briefly; come, instance.
    CORIN
       50  Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
       51  fells, you know, are greasy.
    TOUCHSTONE
       52  Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
       53  the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
       54  a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
    CORIN
       55  Besides, our hands are hard.
    TOUCHSTONE
       56  Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
       57  A more sounder instance, come.
    CORIN
       58  And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
       59  our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
       60  courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
    TOUCHSTONE
       61  Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
       62  good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
       63  perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
       64  very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
    CORIN
       65  You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.
    TOUCHSTONE
       66  Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
       67  God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
    CORIN
       68  Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
       69  that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
       70  happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
       71  harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
       72  graze and my lambs suck.
    TOUCHSTONE
       73  That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
       74  and the rams together and to offer to get your
       75  living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
       76  bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
       77  twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
       78  out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
       79  damned for this, the devil himself will have no
       80  shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
       81  'scape.
    CORIN
       82  Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.
  Direction: Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading
    ROSALIND
       83  From the east to western Ind,
       84  No jewel is like Rosalind.
       85  Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
       86  Through all the world bears Rosalind.
       87  All the pictures fairest lined
       88  Are but black to Rosalind.
       89  Let no fair be kept in mind
       90  But the fair of Rosalind.
    TOUCHSTONE
       91  I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and
       92  suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
       93  right butter-women's rank to market.
    ROSALIND
       94  Out, fool!
    TOUCHSTONE
       95  For a taste:
       96  If a hart do lack a hind,
       97  Let him seek out Rosalind.
       98  If the cat will after kind,
       99  So be sure will Rosalind.
      100  Winter garments must be lined,
      101  So must slender Rosalind.
      102  They that reap must sheaf and bind;
      103  Then to cart with Rosalind.
      104  Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
      105  Such a nut is Rosalind.
      106  He that sweetest rose will find
      107  Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
      108  This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
      109  infect yourself with them?
    ROSALIND
      110  Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
    TOUCHSTONE
      111  Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
    ROSALIND
      112  I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
      113  with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
      114  i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
      115  ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.
    TOUCHSTONE
      116  You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the
      117  forest judge.
  Direction: Enter CELIA, with a writing
    ROSALIND
      118  Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.
    CELIA
      119  [Reads]
      120  Why should this a desert be?
      121  For it is unpeopled? No:
      122  Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
      123  That shall civil sayings show:
      124  Some, how brief the life of man
      125  Runs his erring pilgrimage,
      126  That the stretching of a span
      127  Buckles in his sum of age;
      128  Some, of violated vows
      129  'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
      130  But upon the fairest boughs,
      131  Or at every sentence end,
      132  Will I Rosalinda write,
      133  Teaching all that read to know
      134  The quintessence of every sprite
      135  Heaven would in little show.
      136  Therefore Heaven Nature charged
      137  That one body should be fill'd
      138  With all graces wide-enlarged:
      139  Nature presently distill'd
      140  Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
      141  Cleopatra's majesty,
      142  Atalanta's better part,
      143  Sad Lucretia's modesty.
      144  Thus Rosalind of many parts
      145  By heavenly synod was devised,
      146  Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
      147  To have the touches dearest prized.
      148  Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
      149  And I to live and die her slave.
    ROSALIND
      150  O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love
      151  have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never
      152  cried 'Have patience, good people!'
    CELIA
      153  How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.
      154  Go with him, sirrah.
    TOUCHSTONE
      155  Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
      156  though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
  Direction: Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
    CELIA
      157  Didst thou hear these verses?
    ROSALIND
      158  O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of
      159  them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
    CELIA
      160  That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.
    ROSALIND
      161  Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
      162  themselves without the verse and therefore stood
      163  lamely in the verse.
    CELIA
      164  But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
      165  should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
    ROSALIND
      166  I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
      167  before you came; for look here what I found on a
      168  palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
      169  Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I
      170  can hardly remember.
    CELIA
      171  Trow you who hath done this?
    ROSALIND
      172  Is it a man?
    CELIA
      173  And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
      174  Change you colour?
    ROSALIND
      175  I prithee, who?
    CELIA
      176  O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to
      177  meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
      178  and so encounter.
    ROSALIND
      179  Nay, but who is it?
    CELIA
      180  Is it possible?
    ROSALIND
      181  Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,
      182  tell me who it is.
    CELIA
      183  O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
      184  wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
      185  out of all hooping!
    ROSALIND
      186  Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
      187  caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in
      188  my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
      189  South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it
      190  quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
      191  stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
      192  out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
      193  mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at
      194  all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that
      195  may drink thy tidings.
    CELIA
      196  So you may put a man in your belly.
    ROSALIND
      197  Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his
      198  head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?
    CELIA
      199  Nay, he hath but a little beard.
    ROSALIND
      200  Why, God will send more, if the man will be
      201  thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if
      202  thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
    CELIA
      203  It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's
      204  heels and your heart both in an instant.
    ROSALIND
      205  Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and
      206  true maid.
    CELIA
      207  I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
    ROSALIND
      208  Orlando?
    CELIA
      209  Orlando.
    ROSALIND
      210  Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and
      211  hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
      212  he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
      213  him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
      214  How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
      215  him again? Answer me in one word.
    CELIA
      216  You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
      217  word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
      218  say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
      219  answer in a catechism.
    ROSALIND
      220  But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
      221  man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
      222  day he wrestled?
    CELIA
      223  It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
      224  propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
      225  finding him, and relish it with good observance.
      226  I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
    ROSALIND
      227  It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops
      228  forth such fruit.
    CELIA
      229  Give me audience, good madam.
    ROSALIND
      230  Proceed.
    CELIA
      231  There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.
    ROSALIND
      232  Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
      233  becomes the ground.
    CELIA
      234  Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
      235  unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
    ROSALIND
      236  O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
    CELIA
      237  I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
      238  me out of tune.
    ROSALIND
      239  Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must
      240  speak. Sweet, say on.
    CELIA
      241  You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
  Direction: Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
    ROSALIND
      242  'Tis he: slink by, and note him.
    JAQUES
      243  I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had
      244  as lief have been myself alone.
    ORLANDO
      245  And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
      246  too for your society.
    JAQUES
      247  God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
    ORLANDO
      248  I do desire we may be better strangers.
    JAQUES
      249  I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
      250  love-songs in their barks.
    ORLANDO
      251  I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
      252  them ill-favouredly.
    JAQUES
      253  Rosalind is your love's name?
    ORLANDO
      254  Yes, just.
    JAQUES
      255  I do not like her name.
    ORLANDO
      256  There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
      257  christened.
    JAQUES
      258  What stature is she of?
    ORLANDO
      259  Just as high as my heart.
    JAQUES
      260  You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
      261  acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
      262  out of rings?
    ORLANDO
      263  Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from
      264  whence you have studied your questions.
    JAQUES
      265  You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
      266  Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
      267  we two will rail against our mistress the world and
      268  all our misery.
    ORLANDO
      269  I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
      270  against whom I know most faults.
    JAQUES
      271  The worst fault you have is to be in love.
    ORLANDO
      272  'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
      273  I am weary of you.
    JAQUES
      274  By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
      275  you.
    ORLANDO
      276  He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
      277  shall see him.
    JAQUES
      278  There I shall see mine own figure.
    ORLANDO
      279  Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
    JAQUES
      280  I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
      281  Signior Love.
    ORLANDO
      282  I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
      283  Melancholy.
  Direction: Exit JAQUES
    ROSALIND
      284  [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him, like a saucy
      285  lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
      286  Do you hear, forester?
    ORLANDO
      287  Very well: what would you?
    ROSALIND
      288  I pray you, what is't o'clock?
    ORLANDO
      289  You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
      290  in the forest.
    ROSALIND
      291  Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
      292  sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
      293  detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
    ORLANDO
      294  And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
      295  been as proper?
    ROSALIND
      296  By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
      297  divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
      298  withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
      299  withal and who he stands still withal.
    ORLANDO
      300  I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
    ROSALIND
      301  Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
      302  contract of her marriage and the day it is
      303  solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
      304  Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
      305  seven year.
    ORLANDO
      306  Who ambles Time withal?
    ROSALIND
      307  With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
      308  hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
      309  he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
      310  he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
      311  and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
      312  of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.
    ORLANDO
      313  Who doth he gallop withal?
    ROSALIND
      314  With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
      315  softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
    ORLANDO
      316  Who stays it still withal?
    ROSALIND
      317  With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
      318  term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
    ORLANDO
      319  Where dwell you, pretty youth?
    ROSALIND
      320  With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
      321  skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
    ORLANDO
      322  Are you native of this place?
    ROSALIND
      323  As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
    ORLANDO
      324  Your accent is something finer than you could
      325  purchase in so removed a dwelling.
    ROSALIND
      326  I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
      327  religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
      328  in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
      329  too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
      330  him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
      331  I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
      332  giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
      333  whole sex withal.
    ORLANDO
      334  Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
      335  laid to the charge of women?
    ROSALIND
      336  There were none principal; they were all like one
      337  another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
      338  monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
    ORLANDO
      339  I prithee, recount some of them.
    ROSALIND
      340  No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
      341  are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
      342  abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
      343  their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
      344  on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
      345  Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
      346  give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
      347  quotidian of love upon him.
    ORLANDO
      348  I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
      349  your remedy.
    ROSALIND
      350  There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
      351  taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
      352  of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
    ORLANDO
      353  What were his marks?
    ROSALIND
      354  A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
      355  sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
      356  spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
      357  which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
      358  simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
      359  revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
      360  bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
      361  untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
      362  careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
      363  are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
      364  loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
    ORLANDO
      365  Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
    ROSALIND
      366  Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
      367  love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
      368  do than to confess she does: that is one of the
      369  points in the which women still give the lie to
      370  their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
      371  that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
      372  is so admired?
    ORLANDO
      373  I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
      374  Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
    ROSALIND
      375  But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
    ORLANDO
      376  Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
    ROSALIND
      377  Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
      378  as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
      379  the reason why they are not so punished and cured
      380  is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
      381  are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
    ORLANDO
      382  Did you ever cure any so?
    ROSALIND
      383  Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
      384  his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
      385  woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
      386  youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
      387  and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
      388  inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
      389  passion something and for no passion truly any
      390  thing, as boys and women are for the most part
      391  cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
      392  him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
      393  for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
      394  from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
      395  madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
      396  the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
      397  And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
      398  me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
      399  heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.
    ORLANDO
      400  I would not be cured, youth.
    ROSALIND
      401  I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
      402  and come every day to my cote and woo me.
    ORLANDO
      403  Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
      404  where it is.
    ROSALIND
      405  Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
      406  you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
      407  Will you go?
    ORLANDO
      408  With all my heart, good youth.
    ROSALIND
      409  Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?
  Direction: Exeunt
