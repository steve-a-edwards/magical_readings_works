          As You Like It : Act 5 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The forest.
  Direction: Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER
    ORLANDO
        1  Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you
        2  should like her? that but seeing you should love
        3  her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should
        4  grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?
    OLIVER
        5  Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the
        6  poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden
        7  wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,
        8  I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;
        9  consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
       10  shall be to your good; for my father's house and all
       11  the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I
       12  estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.
    ORLANDO
       13  You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:
       14  thither will I invite the duke and all's contented
       15  followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look
       16  you, here comes my Rosalind.
  Direction: Enter ROSALIND
    ROSALIND
       17  God save you, brother.
    OLIVER
       18  And you, fair sister.
  Direction: Exit
    ROSALIND
       19  O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee
       20  wear thy heart in a scarf!
    ORLANDO
       21  It is my arm.
    ROSALIND
       22  I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
       23  of a lion.
    ORLANDO
       24  Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
    ROSALIND
       25  Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
       26  swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?
    ORLANDO
       27  Ay, and greater wonders than that.
    ROSALIND
       28  O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was
       29  never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
       30  and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and
       31  overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner
       32  met but they looked, no sooner looked but they
       33  loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner
       34  sighed but they asked one another the reason, no
       35  sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;
       36  and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
       37  to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or
       38  else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
       39  the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs
       40  cannot part them.
    ORLANDO
       41  They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the
       42  duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it
       43  is to look into happiness through another man's
       44  eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
       45  the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
       46  think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
    ROSALIND
       47  Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
    ORLANDO
       48  I can live no longer by thinking.
    ROSALIND
       49  I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
       50  Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,
       51  that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I
       52  speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
       53  of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;
       54  neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
       55  some little measure draw a belief from you, to do
       56  yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if
       57  you please, that I can do strange things: I have,
       58  since I was three year old, conversed with a
       59  magician, most profound in his art and yet not
       60  damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
       61  as your gesture cries it out, when your brother
       62  marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into
       63  what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is
       64  not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient
       65  to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
       66  as she is and without any danger.
    ORLANDO
       67  Speakest thou in sober meanings?
    ROSALIND
       68  By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I
       69  say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your
       70  best array: bid your friends; for if you will be
       71  married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.
  Direction: Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
       72  Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.
    PHEBE
       73  Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
       74  To show the letter that I writ to you.
    ROSALIND
       75  I care not if I have: it is my study
       76  To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
       77  You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
       78  Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
    PHEBE
       79  Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
    SILVIUS
       80  It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
       81  And so am I for Phebe.
    PHEBE
       82  And I for Ganymede.
    ORLANDO
       83  And I for Rosalind.
    ROSALIND
       84  And I for no woman.
    SILVIUS
       85  It is to be all made of faith and service;
       86  And so am I for Phebe.
    PHEBE
       87  And I for Ganymede.
    ORLANDO
       88  And I for Rosalind.
    ROSALIND
       89  And I for no woman.
    SILVIUS
       90  It is to be all made of fantasy,
       91  All made of passion and all made of wishes,
       92  All adoration, duty, and observance,
       93  All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
       94  All purity, all trial, all observance;
       95  And so am I for Phebe.
    PHEBE
       96  And so am I for Ganymede.
    ORLANDO
       97  And so am I for Rosalind.
    ROSALIND
       98  And so am I for no woman.
    PHEBE
       99  If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
    SILVIUS
      100  If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
    ORLANDO
      101  If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
    ROSALIND
      102  Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
    ORLANDO
      103  To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
    ROSALIND
      104  Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling
      105  of Irish wolves against the moon.
  Direction: To SILVIUS
      106  I will help you, if I can:
  Direction: To PHEBE
      107  I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.
  Direction: To PHEBE
      108  I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be
      109  married to-morrow:
  Direction: To ORLANDO
      110  I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
      111  shall be married to-morrow:
  Direction: To SILVIUS
      112  I will content you, if what pleases you contents
      113  you, and you shall be married to-morrow.
  Direction: To ORLANDO
      114  As you love Rosalind, meet:
  Direction: To SILVIUS
      115  as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,
      116  I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.
    SILVIUS
      117  I'll not fail, if I live.
    PHEBE
      118  Nor I.
    ORLANDO
      119  Nor I.
  Direction: Exeunt
