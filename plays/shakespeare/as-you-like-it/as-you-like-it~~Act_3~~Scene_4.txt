          As You Like It : Act 3 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. The forest.
  Direction: Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
    ROSALIND
        1  Never talk to me; I will weep.
    CELIA
        2  Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider
        3  that tears do not become a man.
    ROSALIND
        4  But have I not cause to weep?
    CELIA
        5  As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
    ROSALIND
        6  His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
    CELIA
        7  Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
        8  Judas's own children.
    ROSALIND
        9  I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
    CELIA
       10  An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
    ROSALIND
       11  And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
       12  of holy bread.
    CELIA
       13  He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
       14  of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
       15  the very ice of chastity is in them.
    ROSALIND
       16  But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
       17  comes not?
    CELIA
       18  Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
    ROSALIND
       19  Do you think so?
    CELIA
       20  Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
       21  horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
       22  think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
       23  worm-eaten nut.
    ROSALIND
       24  Not true in love?
    CELIA
       25  Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
    ROSALIND
       26  You have heard him swear downright he was.
    CELIA
       27  'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
       28  no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
       29  both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
       30  here in the forest on the duke your father.
    ROSALIND
       31  I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
       32  him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
       33  him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
       34  But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
       35  man as Orlando?
    CELIA
       36  O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
       37  speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
       38  them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
       39  his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
       40  but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
       41  goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
       42  guides. Who comes here?
  Direction: Enter CORIN
    CORIN
       43  Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
       44  After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
       45  Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
       46  Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
       47  That was his mistress.
    CELIA
       48  Well, and what of him?
    CORIN
       49  If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
       50  Between the pale complexion of true love
       51  And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
       52  Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
       53  If you will mark it.
    ROSALIND
       54  O, come, let us remove:
       55  The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
       56  Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
       57  I'll prove a busy actor in their play.
  Direction: Exeunt
