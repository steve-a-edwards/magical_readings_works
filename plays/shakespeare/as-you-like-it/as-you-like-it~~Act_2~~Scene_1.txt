          As You Like It : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. The Forest of Arden.
  Direction: Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords, like foresters
    DUKE SENIOR
        1  Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
        2  Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
        3  Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
        4  More free from peril than the envious court?
        5  Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
        6  The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
        7  And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
        8  Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
        9  Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
       10  'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
       11  That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
       12  Sweet are the uses of adversity,
       13  Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
       14  Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
       15  And this our life exempt from public haunt
       16  Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
       17  Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
       18  I would not change it.
    AMIENS
       19  Happy is your grace,
       20  That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
       21  Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
    DUKE SENIOR
       22  Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
       23  And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
       24  Being native burghers of this desert city,
       25  Should in their own confines with forked heads
       26  Have their round haunches gored.
    First Lord
       27  Indeed, my lord,
       28  The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
       29  And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
       30  Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
       31  To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
       32  Did steal behind him as he lay along
       33  Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
       34  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
       35  To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
       36  That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
       37  Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
       38  The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
       39  That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
       40  Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
       41  Coursed one another down his innocent nose
       42  In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
       43  Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
       44  Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
       45  Augmenting it with tears.
    DUKE SENIOR
       46  But what said Jaques?
       47  Did he not moralize this spectacle?
    First Lord
       48  O, yes, into a thousand similes.
       49  First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
       50  'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
       51  As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
       52  To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
       53  Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
       54  ''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
       55  The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
       56  Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
       57  And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
       58  'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
       59  'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
       60  Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
       61  Thus most invectively he pierceth through
       62  The body of the country, city, court,
       63  Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
       64  Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
       65  To fright the animals and to kill them up
       66  In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
    DUKE SENIOR
       67  And did you leave him in this contemplation?
    Second Lord
       68  We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
       69  Upon the sobbing deer.
    DUKE SENIOR
       70  Show me the place:
       71  I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
       72  For then he's full of matter.
    First Lord
       73  I'll bring you to him straight.
  Direction: Exeunt
