SCENE III. Another room In the castle.
  Direction: Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA and Attendants
    LODOVICO
        1  I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
    OTHELLO
        2  O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
    LODOVICO
        3  Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
    DESDEMONA
        4  Your honour is most welcome.
    OTHELLO
        5  Will you walk, sir?
        6  O,--Desdemona,--
    DESDEMONA
        7  My lord?
    OTHELLO
        8  Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
        9  forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.
    DESDEMONA
       10  I will, my lord.
  Direction: Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants
    EMILIA
       11  How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.
    DESDEMONA
       12  He says he will return incontinent:
       13  He hath commanded me to go to bed,
       14  And bade me to dismiss you.
    EMILIA
       15  Dismiss me!
    DESDEMONA
       16  It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.
       17  Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
       18  We must not now displease him.
    EMILIA
       19  I would you had never seen him!
    DESDEMONA
       20  So would not I my love doth so approve him,
       21  That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--
       22  Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.
    EMILIA
       23  I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
    DESDEMONA
       24  All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
       25  If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me
       26  In one of those same sheets.
    EMILIA
       27  Come, come you talk.
    DESDEMONA
       28  My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
       29  She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
       30  And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
       31  An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
       32  And she died singing it: that song to-night
       33  Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,
       34  But to go hang my head all at one side,
       35  And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.
    EMILIA
       36  Shall I go fetch your night-gown?
    DESDEMONA
       37  No, unpin me here.
       38  This Lodovico is a proper man.
    EMILIA
       39  A very handsome man.
    DESDEMONA
       40  He speaks well.
    EMILIA
       41  I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
       42  to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
    DESDEMONA
       43  [Singing] The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
       44  Sing all a green willow:
       45  Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
       46  Sing willow, willow, willow:
       47  The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
       48  Sing willow, willow, willow;
       49  Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;
       50  Lay by these:--
  Direction: Singing
       51  Sing willow, willow, willow;
       52  Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--
  Direction: Singing
       53  Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
       54  Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-
       55  Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?
    EMILIA
       56  It's the wind.
    DESDEMONA
       57  [Singing] I call'd my love false love; but what
       58  said he then?
       59  Sing willow, willow, willow:
       60  If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!
       61  So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
       62  Doth that bode weeping?
    EMILIA
       63  'Tis neither here nor there.
    DESDEMONA
       64  I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
       65  Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--
       66  That there be women do abuse their husbands
       67  In such gross kind?
    EMILIA
       68  There be some such, no question.
    DESDEMONA
       69  Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
    EMILIA
       70  Why, would not you?
    DESDEMONA
       71  No, by this heavenly light!
    EMILIA
       72  Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
       73  I might do't as well i' the dark.
    DESDEMONA
       74  Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
    EMILIA
       75  The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
       76  For a small vice.
    DESDEMONA
       77  In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
    EMILIA
       78  In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had
       79  done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a
       80  joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
       81  gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty
       82  exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would
       83  not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
       84  monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.
    DESDEMONA
       85  Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
       86  For the whole world.
    EMILIA
       87  Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
       88  having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your
       89  own world, and you might quickly make it right.
    DESDEMONA
       90  I do not think there is any such woman.
    EMILIA
       91  Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would
       92  store the world they played for.
       93  But I do think it is their husbands' faults
       94  If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
       95  And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
       96  Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
       97  Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
       98  Or scant our former having in despite;
       99  Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
      100  Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
      101  Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
      102  And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
      103  As husbands have. What is it that they do
      104  When they change us for others? Is it sport?
      105  I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
      106  I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
      107  It is so too: and have not we affections,
      108  Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
      109  Then let them use us well: else let them know,
      110  The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
    DESDEMONA
      111  Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
      112  Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
  Direction: Exeunt
