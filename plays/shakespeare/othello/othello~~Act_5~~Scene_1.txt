          Othello : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Cyprus. A street.
  Direction: Enter IAGO and RODERIGO
    IAGO
        1  Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
        2  Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
        3  Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
        4  It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
        5  And fix most firm thy resolution.
    RODERIGO
        6  Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
    IAGO
        7  Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.
  Direction: Retires
    RODERIGO
        8  I have no great devotion to the deed;
        9  And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
       10  'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.
    IAGO
       11  I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
       12  And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
       13  Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
       14  Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
       15  He calls me to a restitution large
       16  Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
       17  As gifts to Desdemona;
       18  It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
       19  He hath a daily beauty in his life
       20  That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
       21  May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
       22  No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.
  Direction: Enter CASSIO
    RODERIGO
       23  I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!
  Direction: Makes a pass at CASSIO
    CASSIO
       24  That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
       25  But that my coat is better than thou know'st
       26  I will make proof of thine.
  Direction: Draws, and wounds RODERIGO
    RODERIGO
       27  O, I am slain!
  Direction: IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit
    CASSIO
       28  I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!
  Direction: Falls
  Direction: Enter OTHELLO
    OTHELLO
       29  The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.
    RODERIGO
       30  O, villain that I am!
    OTHELLO
       31  It is even so.
    CASSIO
       32  O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!
    OTHELLO
       33  'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,
       34  That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
       35  Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
       36  And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
       37  Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
       38  Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO
    CASSIO
       39  What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!
    GRATIANO
       40  'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
    CASSIO
       41  O, help!
    LODOVICO
       42  Hark!
    RODERIGO
       43  O wretched villain!
    LODOVICO
       44  Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
       45  These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
       46  To come in to the cry without more help.
    RODERIGO
       47  Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
    LODOVICO
       48  Hark!
  Direction: Re-enter IAGO, with a light
    GRATIANO
       49  Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
    IAGO
       50  Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?
    LODOVICO
       51  We do not know.
    IAGO
       52  Did not you hear a cry?
    CASSIO
       53  Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
    IAGO
       54  What's the matter?
    GRATIANO
       55  This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
    LODOVICO
       56  The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
    IAGO
       57  What are you here that cry so grievously?
    CASSIO
       58  Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
       59  Give me some help.
    IAGO
       60  O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?
    CASSIO
       61  I think that one of them is hereabout,
       62  And cannot make away.
    IAGO
       63  O treacherous villains!
       64  What are you there? come in, and give some help.
  Direction: To LODOVICO and GRATIANO
    RODERIGO
       65  O, help me here!
    CASSIO
       66  That's one of them.
    IAGO
       67  O murderous slave! O villain!
  Direction: Stabs RODERIGO
    RODERIGO
       68  O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
    IAGO
       69  Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--
       70  How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--
       71  What may you be? are you of good or evil?
    LODOVICO
       72  As you shall prove us, praise us.
    IAGO
       73  Signior Lodovico?
    LODOVICO
       74  He, sir.
    IAGO
       75  I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
    GRATIANO
       76  Cassio!
    IAGO
       77  How is't, brother!
    CASSIO
       78  My leg is cut in two.
    IAGO
       79  Marry, heaven forbid!
       80  Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
  Direction: Enter BIANCA
    BIANCA
       81  What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?
    IAGO
       82  Who is't that cried!
    BIANCA
       83  O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,
       84  Cassio, Cassio!
    IAGO
       85  O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
       86  Who they should be that have thus many led you?
    CASSIO
       87  No.
    GRATIANO
       88  I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.
    IAGO
       89  Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
       90  To bear him easily hence!
    BIANCA
       91  Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
    IAGO
       92  Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
       93  To be a party in this injury.
       94  Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
       95  Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
       96  Alas my friend and my dear countryman
       97  Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.
    GRATIANO
       98  What, of Venice?
    IAGO
       99  Even he, sir; did you know him?
    GRATIANO
      100  Know him! ay.
    IAGO
      101  Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
      102  These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
      103  That so neglected you.
    GRATIANO
      104  I am glad to see you.
    IAGO
      105  How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
    GRATIANO
      106  Roderigo!
    IAGO
      107  He, he 'tis he.
  Direction: A chair brought in
      108  O, that's well said; the chair!
    GRATIANO
      109  Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
      110  I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
  Direction: To BIANCA
      111  For you, mistress,
      112  Save you your labour. He that lies slain
      113  here, Cassio,
      114  Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?
    CASSIO
      115  None in the world; nor do I know the man.
    IAGO
      116  [To BIANCA] What, look you pale? O, bear him out
      117  o' the air.
  Direction: CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off
      118  Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
      119  Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
      120  Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
      121  Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
      122  Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,
      123  Though tongues were out of use.
  Direction: Enter EMILIA
    EMILIA
      124  'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?
    IAGO
      125  Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
      126  By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
      127  He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
    EMILIA
      128  Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
    IAGO
      129  This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
      130  Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
  Direction: To BIANCA
      131  What, do you shake at that?
    BIANCA
      132  He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
    IAGO
      133  O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
    EMILIA
      134  Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
    BIANCA
      135  I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
      136  As you that thus abuse me.
    EMILIA
      137  As I! foh! fie upon thee!
    IAGO
      138  Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
      139  Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
      140  Emilia run you to the citadel,
      141  And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
      142  Will you go on? I pray.
  Direction: Aside
      143  This is the night
      144  That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
  Direction: Exeunt
