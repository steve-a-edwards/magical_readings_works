          Othello : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle.
  Direction: Enter OTHELLO and IAGO
    IAGO
        1  Will you think so?
    OTHELLO
        2  Think so, Iago!
    IAGO
        3  What,
        4  To kiss in private?
    OTHELLO
        5  An unauthorized kiss.
    IAGO
        6  Or to be naked with her friend in bed
        7  An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
    OTHELLO
        8  Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
        9  It is hypocrisy against the devil:
       10  They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
       11  The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
    IAGO
       12  So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:
       13  But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--
    OTHELLO
       14  What then?
    IAGO
       15  Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
       16  She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
    OTHELLO
       17  She is protectress of her honour too:
       18  May she give that?
    IAGO
       19  Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
       20  They have it very oft that have it not:
       21  But, for the handkerchief,--
    OTHELLO
       22  By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
       23  Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,
       24  As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
       25  Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.
    IAGO
       26  Ay, what of that?
    OTHELLO
       27  That's not so good now.
    IAGO
       28  What,
       29  If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
       30  Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,
       31  Who having, by their own importunate suit,
       32  Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
       33  Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
       34  But they must blab--
    OTHELLO
       35  Hath he said any thing?
    IAGO
       36  He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
       37  No more than he'll unswear.
    OTHELLO
       38  What hath he said?
    IAGO
       39  'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.
    OTHELLO
       40  What? what?
    IAGO
       41  Lie--
    OTHELLO
       42  With her?
    IAGO
       43  With her, on her; what you will.
    OTHELLO
       44  Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when
       45  they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
       46  --Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To
       47  confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be
       48  hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.
       49  Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
       50  passion without some instruction. It is not words
       51  that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
       52  --Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--
  Direction: Falls in a trance
    IAGO
       53  Work on,
       54  My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;
       55  And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
       56  All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
       57  My lord, I say! Othello!
  Direction: Enter CASSIO
       58  How now, Cassio!
    CASSIO
       59  What's the matter?
    IAGO
       60  My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
       61  This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.
    CASSIO
       62  Rub him about the temples.
    IAGO
       63  No, forbear;
       64  The lethargy must have his quiet course:
       65  If not, he foams at mouth and by and by
       66  Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
       67  Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
       68  He will recover straight: when he is gone,
       69  I would on great occasion speak with you.
  Direction: Exit CASSIO
       70  How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?
    OTHELLO
       71  Dost thou mock me?
    IAGO
       72  I mock you! no, by heaven.
       73  Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
    OTHELLO
       74  A horned man's a monster and a beast.
    IAGO
       75  There's many a beast then in a populous city,
       76  And many a civil monster.
    OTHELLO
       77  Did he confess it?
    IAGO
       78  Good sir, be a man;
       79  Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
       80  May draw with you: there's millions now alive
       81  That nightly lie in those unproper beds
       82  Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
       83  O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
       84  To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
       85  And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;
       86  And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
    OTHELLO
       87  O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
    IAGO
       88  Stand you awhile apart;
       89  Confine yourself but in a patient list.
       90  Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
       91  A passion most unsuiting such a man--
       92  Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
       93  And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
       94  Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
       95  The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
       96  And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
       97  That dwell in every region of his face;
       98  For I will make him tell the tale anew,
       99  Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
      100  He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
      101  I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
      102  Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
      103  And nothing of a man.
    OTHELLO
      104  Dost thou hear, Iago?
      105  I will be found most cunning in my patience;
      106  But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.
    IAGO
      107  That's not amiss;
      108  But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
  Direction: OTHELLO retires
      109  Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
      110  A housewife that by selling her desires
      111  Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
      112  That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
      113  To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
      114  He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
      115  From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
  Direction: Re-enter CASSIO
      116  As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
      117  And his unbookish jealousy must construe
      118  Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,
      119  Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?
    CASSIO
      120  The worser that you give me the addition
      121  Whose want even kills me.
    IAGO
      122  Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
  Direction: Speaking lower
      123  Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
      124  How quickly should you speed!
    CASSIO
      125  Alas, poor caitiff!
    OTHELLO
      126  Look, how he laughs already!
    IAGO
      127  I never knew woman love man so.
    CASSIO
      128  Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.
    OTHELLO
      129  Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.
    IAGO
      130  Do you hear, Cassio?
    OTHELLO
      131  Now he importunes him
      132  To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.
    IAGO
      133  She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
      134  Do you intend it?
    CASSIO
      135  Ha, ha, ha!
    OTHELLO
      136  Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?
    CASSIO
      137  I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some
      138  charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
      139  Ha, ha, ha!
    OTHELLO
      140  So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.
    IAGO
      141  'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
    CASSIO
      142  Prithee, say true.
    IAGO
      143  I am a very villain else.
    OTHELLO
      144  Have you scored me? Well.
    CASSIO
      145  This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
      146  persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and
      147  flattery, not out of my promise.
    OTHELLO
      148  Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
    CASSIO
      149  She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
      150  I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
      151  certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
      152  and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--
    OTHELLO
      153  Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
      154  imports it.
    CASSIO
      155  So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
      156  and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!
    OTHELLO
      157  Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,
      158  I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall
      159  throw it to.
    CASSIO
      160  Well, I must leave her company.
    IAGO
      161  Before me! look, where she comes.
    CASSIO
      162  'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.
  Direction: Enter BIANCA
      163  What do you mean by this haunting of me?
    BIANCA
      164  Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you
      165  mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
      166  I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
      167  work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find
      168  it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
      169  This is some minx's token, and I must take out the
      170  work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
      171  you had it, I'll take out no work on't.
    CASSIO
      172  How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
    OTHELLO
      173  By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
    BIANCA
      174  An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you
      175  will not, come when you are next prepared for.
  Direction: Exit
    IAGO
      176  After her, after her.
    CASSIO
      177  'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.
    IAGO
      178  Will you sup there?
    CASSIO
      179  'Faith, I intend so.
    IAGO
      180  Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain
      181  speak with you.
    CASSIO
      182  Prithee, come; will you?
    IAGO
      183  Go to; say no more.
  Direction: Exit CASSIO
    OTHELLO
      184  [Advancing] How shall I murder him, Iago?
    IAGO
      185  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
    OTHELLO
      186  O Iago!
    IAGO
      187  And did you see the handkerchief?
    OTHELLO
      188  Was that mine?
    IAGO
      189  Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
      190  foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he
      191  hath given it his whore.
    OTHELLO
      192  I would have him nine years a-killing.
      193  A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!
    IAGO
      194  Nay, you must forget that.
    OTHELLO
      195  Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;
      196  for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to
      197  stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the
      198  world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by
      199  an emperor's side and command him tasks.
    IAGO
      200  Nay, that's not your way.
    OTHELLO
      201  Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate
      202  with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she
      203  will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high
      204  and plenteous wit and invention:--
    IAGO
      205  She's the worse for all this.
    OTHELLO
      206  O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so
      207  gentle a condition!
    IAGO
      208  Ay, too gentle.
    OTHELLO
      209  Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!
      210  O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
    IAGO
      211  If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her
      212  patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes
      213  near nobody.
    OTHELLO
      214  I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!
    IAGO
      215  O, 'tis foul in her.
    OTHELLO
      216  With mine officer!
    IAGO
      217  That's fouler.
    OTHELLO
      218  Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not
      219  expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty
      220  unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.
    IAGO
      221  Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even
      222  the bed she hath contaminated.
    OTHELLO
      223  Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.
    IAGO
      224  And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you
      225  shall hear more by midnight.
    OTHELLO
      226  Excellent good.
  Direction: A trumpet within
      227  What trumpet is that same?
    IAGO
      228  Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
      229  Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.
  Direction: Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants
    LODOVICO
      230  Save you, worthy general!
    OTHELLO
      231  With all my heart, sir.
    LODOVICO
      232  The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
  Direction: Gives him a letter
    OTHELLO
      233  I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
  Direction: Opens the letter, and reads
    DESDEMONA
      234  And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
    IAGO
      235  I am very glad to see you, signior
      236  Welcome to Cyprus.
    LODOVICO
      237  I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
    IAGO
      238  Lives, sir.
    DESDEMONA
      239  Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
      240  An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.
    OTHELLO
      241  Are you sure of that?
    DESDEMONA
      242  My lord?
    OTHELLO
      243  [Reads] 'This fail you not to do, as you will--'
    LODOVICO
      244  He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
      245  Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
    DESDEMONA
      246  A most unhappy one: I would do much
      247  To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
    OTHELLO
      248  Fire and brimstone!
    DESDEMONA
      249  My lord?
    OTHELLO
      250  Are you wise?
    DESDEMONA
      251  What, is he angry?
    LODOVICO
      252  May be the letter moved him;
      253  For, as I think, they do command him home,
      254  Deputing Cassio in his government.
    DESDEMONA
      255  Trust me, I am glad on't.
    OTHELLO
      256  Indeed!
    DESDEMONA
      257  My lord?
    OTHELLO
      258  I am glad to see you mad.
    DESDEMONA
      259  Why, sweet Othello,--
    OTHELLO
      260  [Striking her] Devil!
    DESDEMONA
      261  I have not deserved this.
    LODOVICO
      262  My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
      263  Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:
      264  Make her amends; she weeps.
    OTHELLO
      265  O devil, devil!
      266  If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
      267  Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
      268  Out of my sight!
    DESDEMONA
      269  I will not stay to offend you.
  Direction: Going
    LODOVICO
      270  Truly, an obedient lady:
      271  I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
    OTHELLO
      272  Mistress!
    DESDEMONA
      273  My lord?
    OTHELLO
      274  What would you with her, sir?
    LODOVICO
      275  Who, I, my lord?
    OTHELLO
      276  Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
      277  Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
      278  And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
      279  And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
      280  Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
      281  Concerning this, sir,--O well-painted passion!--
      282  I am commanded home. Get you away;
      283  I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
      284  And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
  Direction: Exit DESDEMONA
      285  Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
      286  I do entreat that we may sup together:
      287  You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!
  Direction: Exit
    LODOVICO
      288  Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
      289  Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
      290  Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
      291  The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,
      292  Could neither graze nor pierce?
    IAGO
      293  He is much changed.
    LODOVICO
      294  Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?
    IAGO
      295  He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
      296  What he might be: if what he might he is not,
      297  I would to heaven he were!
    LODOVICO
      298  What, strike his wife!
    IAGO
      299  'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
      300  That stroke would prove the worst!
    LODOVICO
      301  Is it his use?
      302  Or did the letters work upon his blood,
      303  And new-create this fault?
    IAGO
      304  Alas, alas!
      305  It is not honesty in me to speak
      306  What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
      307  And his own courses will denote him so
      308  That I may save my speech: do but go after,
      309  And mark how he continues.
    LODOVICO
      310  I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
  Direction: Exeunt
