          Othello : Act 5 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep; a light burning.
  Direction: Enter OTHELLO
    OTHELLO
        1  It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--
        2  Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--
        3  It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;
        4  Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
        5  And smooth as monumental alabaster.
        6  Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
        7  Put out the light, and then put out the light:
        8  If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
        9  I can again thy former light restore,
       10  Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,
       11  Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
       12  I know not where is that Promethean heat
       13  That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
       14  I cannot give it vital growth again.
       15  It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.
  Direction: Kissing her
       16  Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
       17  Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
       18  Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
       19  And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
       20  So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
       21  But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;
       22  It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.
    DESDEMONA
       23  Who's there? Othello?
    OTHELLO
       24  Ay. Desdemona.
    DESDEMONA
       25  Will you come to bed, my lord?
    OTHELLO
       26  Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?
    DESDEMONA
       27  Ay, my lord.
    OTHELLO
       28  If you bethink yourself of any crime
       29  Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
       30  Solicit for it straight.
    DESDEMONA
       31  Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?
    OTHELLO
       32  Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
       33  I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
       34  No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.
    DESDEMONA
       35  Talk you of killing?
    OTHELLO
       36  Ay, I do.
    DESDEMONA
       37  Then heaven
       38  Have mercy on me!
    OTHELLO
       39  Amen, with all my heart!
    DESDEMONA
       40  If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
    OTHELLO
       41  Hum!
    DESDEMONA
       42  And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
       43  When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,
       44  Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.
    OTHELLO
       45  Think on thy sins.
    DESDEMONA
       46  They are loves I bear to you.
    OTHELLO
       47  Ay, and for that thou diest.
    DESDEMONA
       48  That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
       49  Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
       50  Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
       51  These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
       52  They do not point on me.
    OTHELLO
       53  Peace, and be still!
    DESDEMONA
       54  I will so. What's the matter?
    OTHELLO
       55  That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
       56  Thou gavest to Cassio.
    DESDEMONA
       57  No, by my life and soul!
       58  Send for the man, and ask him.
    OTHELLO
       59  Sweet soul, take heed,
       60  Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.
    DESDEMONA
       61  Ay, but not yet to die.
    OTHELLO
       62  Yes, presently:
       63  Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
       64  For to deny each article with oath
       65  Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
       66  That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.
    DESDEMONA
       67  Then Lord have mercy on me!
    OTHELLO
       68  I say, amen.
    DESDEMONA
       69  And have you mercy too! I never did
       70  Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
       71  But with such general warranty of heaven
       72  As I might love: I never gave him token.
    OTHELLO
       73  By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
       74  O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
       75  And makest me call what I intend to do
       76  A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
       77  I saw the handkerchief.
    DESDEMONA
       78  He found it then;
       79  I never gave it him: send for him hither;
       80  Let him confess a truth.
    OTHELLO
       81  He hath confess'd.
    DESDEMONA
       82  What, my lord?
    OTHELLO
       83  That he hath used thee.
    DESDEMONA
       84  How? unlawfully?
    OTHELLO
       85  Ay.
    DESDEMONA
       86  He will not say so.
    OTHELLO
       87  No, his mouth is stopp'd;
       88  Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
    DESDEMONA
       89  O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?
    OTHELLO
       90  Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
       91  Had stomach for them all.
    DESDEMONA
       92  Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.
    OTHELLO
       93  Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?
    DESDEMONA
       94  O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
    OTHELLO
       95  Down, strumpet!
    DESDEMONA
       96  Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!
    OTHELLO
       97  Nay, if you strive--
    DESDEMONA
       98  But half an hour!
    OTHELLO
       99  Being done, there is no pause.
    DESDEMONA
      100  But while I say one prayer!
    OTHELLO
      101  It is too late.
  Direction: He stifles her
    EMILIA
      102  [Within] My lord , my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!
    OTHELLO
      103  What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
      104  I that am cruel am yet merciful;
      105  I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.
    EMILIA
      106  [Within] What, ho! my lord, my lord!
    OTHELLO
      107  Who's there?
    EMILIA
      108  [Within] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!
    OTHELLO
      109  Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
      110  'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--
      111  The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
      112  Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--
      113  I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?
      114  If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
      115  My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
      116  O insupportable! O heavy hour!
      117  Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
      118  Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
      119  Should yawn at alteration.
    EMILIA
      120  [Within] I do beseech you
      121  That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!
    OTHELLO
      122  I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;
      123  Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
      124  Where art thou?
  Direction: Unlocks the door
  Direction: Enter EMILIA
      125  What's the matter with thee now?
    EMILIA
      126  O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!
    OTHELLO
      127  What, now?
    EMILIA
      128  But now, my lord.
    OTHELLO
      129  It is the very error of the moon;
      130  She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,
      131  And makes men mad.
    EMILIA
      132  Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
      133  Call'd Roderigo.
    OTHELLO
      134  Roderigo kill'd!
      135  And Cassio kill'd!
    EMILIA
      136  No, Cassio is not kill'd.
    OTHELLO
      137  Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
      138  And sweet revenge grows harsh.
    DESDEMONA
      139  O, falsely, falsely murder'd!
    EMILIA
      140  Alas, what cry is that?
    OTHELLO
      141  That! what?
    EMILIA
      142  Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
      143  Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
      144  Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!
    DESDEMONA
      145  A guiltless death I die.
    EMILIA
      146  O, who hath done this deed?
    DESDEMONA
      147  Nobody; I myself. Farewell
      148  Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!
  Direction: Dies
    OTHELLO
      149  Why, how should she be murder'd?
    EMILIA
      150  Alas, who knows?
    OTHELLO
      151  You heard her say herself, it was not I.
    EMILIA
      152  She said so: I must needs report the truth.
    OTHELLO
      153  She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
      154  'Twas I that kill'd her.
    EMILIA
      155  O, the more angel she,
      156  And you the blacker devil!
    OTHELLO
      157  She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
    EMILIA
      158  Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
    OTHELLO
      159  She was false as water.
    EMILIA
      160  Thou art rash as fire, to say
      161  That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!
    OTHELLO
      162  Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
      163  O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
      164  But that I did proceed upon just grounds
      165  To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.
    EMILIA
      166  My husband!
    OTHELLO
      167  Thy husband.
    EMILIA
      168  That she was false to wedlock?
    OTHELLO
      169  Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
      170  If heaven would make me such another world
      171  Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,
      172  I'ld not have sold her for it.
    EMILIA
      173  My husband!
    OTHELLO
      174  Ay, 'twas he that told me first:
      175  An honest man he is, and hates the slime
      176  That sticks on filthy deeds.
    EMILIA
      177  My husband!
    OTHELLO
      178  What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.
    EMILIA
      179  O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,
      180  My husband say that she was false!
    OTHELLO
      181  He, woman;
      182  I say thy husband: dost understand the word?
      183  My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.
    EMILIA
      184  If he say so, may his pernicious soul
      185  Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
      186  She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
    OTHELLO
      187  Ha!
    EMILIA
      188  Do thy worst:
      189  This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
      190  Than thou wast worthy her.
    OTHELLO
      191  Peace, you were best.
    EMILIA
      192  Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
      193  As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
      194  As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--
      195  I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
      196  Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!
      197  The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!
  Direction: Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others
    MONTANO
      198  What is the matter? How now, general!
    EMILIA
      199  O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
      200  That men must lay their murders on your neck.
    GRATIANO
      201  What is the matter?
    EMILIA
      202  Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
      203  He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
      204  I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
      205  Speak, for my heart is full.
    IAGO
      206  I told him what I thought, and told no more
      207  Than what he found himself was apt and true.
    EMILIA
      208  But did you ever tell him she was false?
    IAGO
      209  I did.
    EMILIA
      210  You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
      211  Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
      212  She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?
    IAGO
      213  With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
    EMILIA
      214  I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
      215  My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--
    All
      216  O heavens forfend!
    EMILIA
      217  And your reports have set the murder on.
    OTHELLO
      218  Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.
    GRATIANO
      219  'Tis a strange truth.
    MONTANO
      220  O monstrous act!
    EMILIA
      221  Villany, villany, villany!
      222  I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--
      223  I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--
      224  O villany, villany!
    IAGO
      225  What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.
    EMILIA
      226  Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
      227  'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
      228  Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
    OTHELLO
      229  O! O! O!
  Direction: He falls on the bed
    EMILIA
      230  Nay, lay thee down and roar;
      231  For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
      232  That e'er did lift up eye.
    OTHELLO
      233  [Rising] O, she was foul!
      234  I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,
      235  Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:
      236  I know this act shows horrible and grim.
    GRATIANO
      237  Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:
      238  Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
      239  Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
      240  This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
      241  Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
      242  And fall to reprobation.
    OTHELLO
      243  'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
      244  That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
      245  A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
      246  And she did gratify his amorous works
      247  With that recognizance and pledge of love
      248  Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
      249  It was a handkerchief, an antique token
      250  My father gave my mother.
    EMILIA
      251  O heaven! O heavenly powers!
    IAGO
      252  Come, hold your peace.
    EMILIA
      253  'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
      254  No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
      255  Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
      256  All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.
    IAGO
      257  Be wise, and get you home.
    EMILIA
      258  I will not.
  Direction: IAGO offers to stab EMILIA
    GRATIANO
      259  Fie!
      260  Your sword upon a woman?
    EMILIA
      261  O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
      262  I found by fortune and did give my husband;
      263  For often, with a solemn earnestness,
      264  More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
      265  He begg'd of me to steal it.
    IAGO
      266  Villanous whore!
    EMILIA
      267  She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
      268  And I did give't my husband.
    IAGO
      269  Filth, thou liest!
    EMILIA
      270  By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
      271  O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
      272  Do with so good a woman?
    OTHELLO
      273  Are there no stones in heaven
      274  But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!
  Direction: He runs at IAGO IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit
    GRATIANO
      275  The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
    EMILIA
      276  Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.
    GRATIANO
      277  He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
    MONTANO
      278  'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
      279  Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:
      280  Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
      281  But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,
      282  For 'tis a damned slave.
  Direction: Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO
    OTHELLO
      283  I am not valiant neither,
      284  But ever puny whipster gets my sword:
      285  But why should honour outlive honesty?
      286  Let it go all.
    EMILIA
      287  What did thy song bode, lady?
      288  Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
      289  And die in music.
  Direction: Singing
      290  Willow, willow, willow,--
      291  Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
      292  So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
      293  So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
  Direction: Dies
    OTHELLO
      294  I have another weapon in this chamber;
      295  It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--
      296  O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.
    GRATIANO
      297  [Within] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:
      298  Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
    OTHELLO
      299  Look in upon me then and speak with me,
      300  Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
  Direction: Re-enter GRATIANO
    GRATIANO
      301  What is the matter?
    OTHELLO
      302  Behold, I have a weapon;
      303  A better never did itself sustain
      304  Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,
      305  That, with this little arm and this good sword,
      306  I have made my way through more impediments
      307  Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
      308  Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
      309  Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
      310  Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
      311  And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
      312  Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
      313  Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
      314  And he retires. Where should Othello go?
      315  Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
      316  Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
      317  This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
      318  And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
      319  Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
      320  Whip me, ye devils,
      321  From the possession of this heavenly sight!
      322  Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
      323  Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
      324  O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
      325  Oh! Oh! Oh!
  Direction: Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner
    LODOVICO
      326  Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
    OTHELLO
      327  That's he that was Othello: here I am.
    LODOVICO
      328  Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.
    OTHELLO
      329  I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
      330  If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.
  Direction: Wounds IAGO
    LODOVICO
      331  Wrench his sword from him.
    IAGO
      332  I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.
    OTHELLO
      333  I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;
      334  For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.
    LODOVICO
      335  O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,
      336  Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,
      337  What shall be said to thee?
    OTHELLO
      338  Why, any thing:
      339  An honourable murderer, if you will;
      340  For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.
    LODOVICO
      341  This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:
      342  Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?
    OTHELLO
      343  Ay.
    CASSIO
      344  Dear general, I never gave you cause.
    OTHELLO
      345  I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
      346  Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
      347  Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?
    IAGO
      348  Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
      349  From this time forth I never will speak word.
    LODOVICO
      350  What, not to pray?
    GRATIANO
      351  Torments will ope your lips.
    OTHELLO
      352  Well, thou dost best.
    LODOVICO
      353  Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
      354  Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
      355  Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;
      356  And here another: the one of them imports
      357  The death of Cassio to be undertook
      358  By Roderigo.
    OTHELLO
      359  O villain!
    CASSIO
      360  Most heathenish and most gross!
    LODOVICO
      361  Now here's another discontented paper,
      362  Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
      363  Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
      364  But that belike Iago in the interim
      365  Came in and satisfied him.
    OTHELLO
      366  O the pernicious caitiff!
      367  How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
      368  That was my wife's?
    CASSIO
      369  I found it in my chamber:
      370  And he himself confess'd but even now
      371  That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
      372  Which wrought to his desire.
    OTHELLO
      373  O fool! fool! fool!
    CASSIO
      374  There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
      375  How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
      376  Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
      377  That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
      378  After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
      379  Iago set him on.
    LODOVICO
      380  You must forsake this room, and go with us:
      381  Your power and your command is taken off,
      382  And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
      383  If there be any cunning cruelty
      384  That can torment him much and hold him long,
      385  It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
      386  Till that the nature of your fault be known
      387  To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.
    OTHELLO
      388  Soft you; a word or two before you go.
      389  I have done the state some service, and they know't.
      390  No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
      391  When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
      392  Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
      393  Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
      394  Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
      395  Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
      396  Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
      397  Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
      398  Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
      399  Albeit unused to the melting mood,
      400  Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
      401  Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
      402  And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
      403  Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
      404  Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
      405  I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
      406  And smote him, thus.
  Direction: Stabs himself
    LODOVICO
      407  O bloody period!
    GRATIANO
      408  All that's spoke is marr'd.
    OTHELLO
      409  I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;
      410  Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
  Direction: Falls on the bed, and dies
    CASSIO
      411  This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
      412  For he was great of heart.
    LODOVICO
      413  [To IAGO] O Spartan dog,
      414  More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
      415  Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
      416  This is thy work: the object poisons sight;
      417  Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
      418  And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
      419  For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,
      420  Remains the censure of this hellish villain;
      421  The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!
      422  Myself will straight aboard: and to the state
      423  This heavy act with heavy heart relate.
  Direction: Exeunt
