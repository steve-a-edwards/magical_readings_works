          Othello : Act 3 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The garden of the castle.
  Direction: Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA
    DESDEMONA
        1  Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
        2  All my abilities in thy behalf.
    EMILIA
        3  Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
        4  As if the case were his.
    DESDEMONA
        5  O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
        6  But I will have my lord and you again
        7  As friendly as you were.
    CASSIO
        8  Bounteous madam,
        9  Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
       10  He's never any thing but your true servant.
    DESDEMONA
       11  I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
       12  You have known him long; and be you well assured
       13  He shall in strangeness stand no further off
       14  Than in a polite distance.
    CASSIO
       15  Ay, but, lady,
       16  That policy may either last so long,
       17  Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
       18  Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
       19  That, I being absent and my place supplied,
       20  My general will forget my love and service.
    DESDEMONA
       21  Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
       22  I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
       23  If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
       24  To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
       25  I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
       26  His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
       27  I'll intermingle every thing he does
       28  With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
       29  For thy solicitor shall rather die
       30  Than give thy cause away.
    EMILIA
       31  Madam, here comes my lord.
    CASSIO
       32  Madam, I'll take my leave.
    DESDEMONA
       33  Why, stay, and hear me speak.
    CASSIO
       34  Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
       35  Unfit for mine own purposes.
    DESDEMONA
       36  Well, do your discretion.
  Direction: Exit CASSIO
  Direction: Enter OTHELLO and IAGO
    IAGO
       37  Ha! I like not that.
    OTHELLO
       38  What dost thou say?
    IAGO
       39  Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
    OTHELLO
       40  Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
    IAGO
       41  Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
       42  That he would steal away so guilty-like,
       43  Seeing you coming.
    OTHELLO
       44  I do believe 'twas he.
    DESDEMONA
       45  How now, my lord!
       46  I have been talking with a suitor here,
       47  A man that languishes in your displeasure.
    OTHELLO
       48  Who is't you mean?
    DESDEMONA
       49  Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
       50  If I have any grace or power to move you,
       51  His present reconciliation take;
       52  For if he be not one that truly loves you,
       53  That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
       54  I have no judgment in an honest face:
       55  I prithee, call him back.
    OTHELLO
       56  Went he hence now?
    DESDEMONA
       57  Ay, sooth; so humbled
       58  That he hath left part of his grief with me,
       59  To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
    OTHELLO
       60  Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
    DESDEMONA
       61  But shall't be shortly?
    OTHELLO
       62  The sooner, sweet, for you.
    DESDEMONA
       63  Shall't be to-night at supper?
    OTHELLO
       64  No, not to-night.
    DESDEMONA
       65  To-morrow dinner, then?
    OTHELLO
       66  I shall not dine at home;
       67  I meet the captains at the citadel.
    DESDEMONA
       68  Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
       69  On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
       70  I prithee, name the time, but let it not
       71  Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
       72  And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
       73  Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
       74  Out of their best--is not almost a fault
       75  To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
       76  Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
       77  What you would ask me, that I should deny,
       78  Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
       79  That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
       80  When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
       81  Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
       82  To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--
    OTHELLO
       83  Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
       84  I will deny thee nothing.
    DESDEMONA
       85  Why, this is not a boon;
       86  'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
       87  Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
       88  Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
       89  To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
       90  Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
       91  It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
       92  And fearful to be granted.
    OTHELLO
       93  I will deny thee nothing:
       94  Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
       95  To leave me but a little to myself.
    DESDEMONA
       96  Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.
    OTHELLO
       97  Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.
    DESDEMONA
       98  Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
       99  Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
  Direction: Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
    OTHELLO
      100  Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
      101  But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
      102  Chaos is come again.
    IAGO
      103  My noble lord--
    OTHELLO
      104  What dost thou say, Iago?
    IAGO
      105  Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
      106  Know of your love?
    OTHELLO
      107  He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
    IAGO
      108  But for a satisfaction of my thought;
      109  No further harm.
    OTHELLO
      110  Why of thy thought, Iago?
    IAGO
      111  I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
    OTHELLO
      112  O, yes; and went between us very oft.
    IAGO
      113  Indeed!
    OTHELLO
      114  Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
      115  Is he not honest?
    IAGO
      116  Honest, my lord!
    OTHELLO
      117  Honest! ay, honest.
    IAGO
      118  My lord, for aught I know.
    OTHELLO
      119  What dost thou think?
    IAGO
      120  Think, my lord!
    OTHELLO
      121  Think, my lord!
      122  By heaven, he echoes me,
      123  As if there were some monster in his thought
      124  Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
      125  I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
      126  When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
      127  And when I told thee he was of my counsel
      128  In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
      129  And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
      130  As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
      131  Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
      132  Show me thy thought.
    IAGO
      133  My lord, you know I love you.
    OTHELLO
      134  I think thou dost;
      135  And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
      136  And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
      137  Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
      138  For such things in a false disloyal knave
      139  Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
      140  They are close delations, working from the heart
      141  That passion cannot rule.
    IAGO
      142  For Michael Cassio,
      143  I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
    OTHELLO
      144  I think so too.
    IAGO
      145  Men should be what they seem;
      146  Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
    OTHELLO
      147  Certain, men should be what they seem.
    IAGO
      148  Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.
    OTHELLO
      149  Nay, yet there's more in this:
      150  I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
      151  As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
      152  The worst of words.
    IAGO
      153  Good my lord, pardon me:
      154  Though I am bound to every act of duty,
      155  I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
      156  Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
      157  As where's that palace whereinto foul things
      158  Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
      159  But some uncleanly apprehensions
      160  Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
      161  With meditations lawful?
    OTHELLO
      162  Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
      163  If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
      164  A stranger to thy thoughts.
    IAGO
      165  I do beseech you--
      166  Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
      167  As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
      168  To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
      169  Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
      170  From one that so imperfectly conceits,
      171  Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
      172  Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
      173  It were not for your quiet nor your good,
      174  Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
      175  To let you know my thoughts.
    OTHELLO
      176  What dost thou mean?
    IAGO
      177  Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
      178  Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
      179  Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
      180  'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
      181  But he that filches from me my good name
      182  Robs me of that which not enriches him
      183  And makes me poor indeed.
    OTHELLO
      184  By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
    IAGO
      185  You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
      186  Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
    OTHELLO
      187  Ha!
    IAGO
      188  O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
      189  It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
      190  The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
      191  Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
      192  But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
      193  Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
    OTHELLO
      194  O misery!
    IAGO
      195  Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
      196  But riches fineless is as poor as winter
      197  To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
      198  Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
      199  From jealousy!
    OTHELLO
      200  Why, why is this?
      201  Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
      202  To follow still the changes of the moon
      203  With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
      204  Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
      205  When I shall turn the business of my soul
      206  To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
      207  Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
      208  To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
      209  Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
      210  Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
      211  Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
      212  The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
      213  For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
      214  I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
      215  And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
      216  Away at once with love or jealousy!
    IAGO
      217  I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
      218  To show the love and duty that I bear you
      219  With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
      220  Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
      221  Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
      222  Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
      223  I would not have your free and noble nature,
      224  Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
      225  I know our country disposition well;
      226  In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
      227  They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
      228  Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
    OTHELLO
      229  Dost thou say so?
    IAGO
      230  She did deceive her father, marrying you;
      231  And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
      232  She loved them most.
    OTHELLO
      233  And so she did.
    IAGO
      234  Why, go to then;
      235  She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
      236  To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
      237  He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
      238  I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
      239  For too much loving you.
    OTHELLO
      240  I am bound to thee for ever.
    IAGO
      241  I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
    OTHELLO
      242  Not a jot, not a jot.
    IAGO
      243  I' faith, I fear it has.
      244  I hope you will consider what is spoke
      245  Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
      246  I am to pray you not to strain my speech
      247  To grosser issues nor to larger reach
      248  Than to suspicion.
    OTHELLO
      249  I will not.
    IAGO
      250  Should you do so, my lord,
      251  My speech should fall into such vile success
      252  As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
      253  My lord, I see you're moved.
    OTHELLO
      254  No, not much moved:
      255  I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
    IAGO
      256  Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
    OTHELLO
      257  And yet, how nature erring from itself,--
    IAGO
      258  Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--
      259  Not to affect many proposed matches
      260  Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
      261  Whereto we see in all things nature tends--
      262  Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
      263  Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
      264  But pardon me; I do not in position
      265  Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
      266  Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
      267  May fall to match you with her country forms
      268  And happily repent.
    OTHELLO
      269  Farewell, farewell:
      270  If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
      271  Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:
    IAGO
      272  [Going] My lord, I take my leave.
    OTHELLO
      273  Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
      274  Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
    IAGO
      275  [Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat
      276  your honour
      277  To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
      278  Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
      279  For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
      280  Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
      281  You shall by that perceive him and his means:
      282  Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
      283  With any strong or vehement importunity;
      284  Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
      285  Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
      286  As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
      287  And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.
    OTHELLO
      288  Fear not my government.
    IAGO
      289  I once more take my leave.
  Direction: Exit
    OTHELLO
      290  This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
      291  And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
      292  Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
      293  Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
      294  I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
      295  To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
      296  And have not those soft parts of conversation
      297  That chamberers have, or for I am declined
      298  Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--
      299  She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
      300  Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
      301  That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
      302  And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
      303  And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
      304  Than keep a corner in the thing I love
      305  For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
      306  Prerogatived are they less than the base;
      307  'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
      308  Even then this forked plague is fated to us
      309  When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
  Direction: Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA
      310  If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
      311  I'll not believe't.
    DESDEMONA
      312  How now, my dear Othello!
      313  Your dinner, and the generous islanders
      314  By you invited, do attend your presence.
    OTHELLO
      315  I am to blame.
    DESDEMONA
      316  Why do you speak so faintly?
      317  Are you not well?
    OTHELLO
      318  I have a pain upon my forehead here.
    DESDEMONA
      319  'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
      320  Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
      321  It will be well.
    OTHELLO
      322  Your napkin is too little:
  Direction: He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops
      323  Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.
    DESDEMONA
      324  I am very sorry that you are not well.
  Direction: Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA
    EMILIA
      325  I am glad I have found this napkin:
      326  This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
      327  My wayward husband hath a hundred times
      328  Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
      329  For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
      330  That she reserves it evermore about her
      331  To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
      332  And give't Iago: what he will do with it
      333  Heaven knows, not I;
      334  I nothing but to please his fantasy.
  Direction: Re-enter Iago
    IAGO
      335  How now! what do you here alone?
    EMILIA
      336  Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
    IAGO
      337  A thing for me? it is a common thing--
    EMILIA
      338  Ha!
    IAGO
      339  To have a foolish wife.
    EMILIA
      340  O, is that all? What will you give me now
      341  For the same handkerchief?
    IAGO
      342  What handkerchief?
    EMILIA
      343  What handkerchief?
      344  Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
      345  That which so often you did bid me steal.
    IAGO
      346  Hast stol'n it from her?
    EMILIA
      347  No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.
      348  And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
      349  Look, here it is.
    IAGO
      350  A good wench; give it me.
    EMILIA
      351  What will you do with 't, that you have been
      352  so earnest
      353  To have me filch it?
    IAGO
      354  [Snatching it] Why, what's that to you?
    EMILIA
      355  If it be not for some purpose of import,
      356  Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
      357  When she shall lack it.
    IAGO
      358  Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
      359  Go, leave me.
  Direction: Exit EMILIA
      360  I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
      361  And let him find it. Trifles light as air
      362  Are to the jealous confirmations strong
      363  As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.
      364  The Moor already changes with my poison:
      365  Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.
      366  Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
      367  But with a little act upon the blood.
      368  Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:
      369  Look, where he comes!
  Direction: Re-enter OTHELLO
      370  Not poppy, nor mandragora,
      371  Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
      372  Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
      373  Which thou owedst yesterday.
    OTHELLO
      374  Ha! ha! false to me?
    IAGO
      375  Why, how now, general! no more of that.
    OTHELLO
      376  Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
      377  I swear 'tis better to be much abused
      378  Than but to know't a little.
    IAGO
      379  How now, my lord!
    OTHELLO
      380  What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
      381  I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
      382  I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
      383  I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
      384  He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
      385  Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.
    IAGO
      386  I am sorry to hear this.
    OTHELLO
      387  I had been happy, if the general camp,
      388  Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
      389  So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever
      390  Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
      391  Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
      392  That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
      393  Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
      394  The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
      395  The royal banner, and all quality,
      396  Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
      397  And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
      398  The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
      399  Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!
    IAGO
      400  Is't possible, my lord?
    OTHELLO
      401  Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
      402  Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
      403  Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
      404  Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
      405  Than answer my waked wrath!
    IAGO
      406  Is't come to this?
    OTHELLO
      407  Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
      408  That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
      409  To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
    IAGO
      410  My noble lord,--
    OTHELLO
      411  If thou dost slander her and torture me,
      412  Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
      413  On horror's head horrors accumulate;
      414  Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
      415  For nothing canst thou to damnation add
      416  Greater than that.
    IAGO
      417  O grace! O heaven forgive me!
      418  Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
      419  God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
      420  That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
      421  O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
      422  To be direct and honest is not safe.
      423  I thank you for this profit; and from hence
      424  I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
    OTHELLO
      425  Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.
    IAGO
      426  I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
      427  And loses that it works for.
    OTHELLO
      428  By the world,
      429  I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
      430  I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
      431  I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
      432  As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
      433  As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
      434  Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
      435  I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
    IAGO
      436  I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
      437  I do repent me that I put it to you.
      438  You would be satisfied?
    OTHELLO
      439  Would! nay, I will.
    IAGO
      440  And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
      441  Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--
      442  Behold her topp'd?
    OTHELLO
      443  Death and damnation! O!
    IAGO
      444  It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
      445  To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
      446  If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
      447  More than their own! What then? how then?
      448  What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
      449  It is impossible you should see this,
      450  Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
      451  As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
      452  As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
      453  If imputation and strong circumstances,
      454  Which lead directly to the door of truth,
      455  Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.
    OTHELLO
      456  Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
    IAGO
      457  I do not like the office:
      458  But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
      459  Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
      460  I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
      461  And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
      462  I could not sleep.
      463  There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
      464  That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
      465  One of this kind is Cassio:
      466  In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
      467  Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
      468  And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
      469  Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
      470  As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
      471  That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
      472  Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
      473  Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'
    OTHELLO
      474  O monstrous! monstrous!
    IAGO
      475  Nay, this was but his dream.
    OTHELLO
      476  But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
      477  'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
    IAGO
      478  And this may help to thicken other proofs
      479  That do demonstrate thinly.
    OTHELLO
      480  I'll tear her all to pieces.
    IAGO
      481  Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
      482  She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
      483  Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
      484  Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
    OTHELLO
      485  I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
    IAGO
      486  I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
      487  I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
      488  See Cassio wipe his beard with.
    OTHELLO
      489  If it be that--
    IAGO
      490  If it be that, or any that was hers,
      491  It speaks against her with the other proofs.
    OTHELLO
      492  O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
      493  One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
      494  Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
      495  All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
      496  'Tis gone.
      497  Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
      498  Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
      499  To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
      500  For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
    IAGO
      501  Yet be content.
    OTHELLO
      502  O, blood, blood, blood!
    IAGO
      503  Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
    OTHELLO
      504  Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
      505  Whose icy current and compulsive course
      506  Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
      507  To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
      508  Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
      509  Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
      510  Till that a capable and wide revenge
      511  Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
  Direction: Kneels
      512  In the due reverence of a sacred vow
      513  I here engage my words.
    IAGO
      514  Do not rise yet.
  Direction: Kneels
      515  Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
      516  You elements that clip us round about,
      517  Witness that here Iago doth give up
      518  The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
      519  To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
      520  And to obey shall be in me remorse,
      521  What bloody business ever.
  Direction: They rise
    OTHELLO
      522  I greet thy love,
      523  Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
      524  And will upon the instant put thee to't:
      525  Within these three days let me hear thee say
      526  That Cassio's not alive.
    IAGO
      527  My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
      528  But let her live.
    OTHELLO
      529  Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
      530  Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
      531  To furnish me with some swift means of death
      532  For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
    IAGO
      533  I am your own for ever.
  Direction: Exeunt
