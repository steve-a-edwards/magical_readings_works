          Othello : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A room in the castle.
  Direction: Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA
    OTHELLO
        1  You have seen nothing then?
    EMILIA
        2  Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
    OTHELLO
        3  Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
    EMILIA
        4  But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
        5  Each syllable that breath made up between them.
    OTHELLO
        6  What, did they never whisper?
    EMILIA
        7  Never, my lord.
    OTHELLO
        8  Nor send you out o' the way?
    EMILIA
        9  Never.
    OTHELLO
       10  To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
    EMILIA
       11  Never, my lord.
    OTHELLO
       12  That's strange.
    EMILIA
       13  I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
       14  Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
       15  Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
       16  If any wretch have put this in your head,
       17  Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
       18  For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
       19  There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
       20  Is foul as slander.
    OTHELLO
       21  Bid her come hither: go.
  Direction: Exit EMILIA
       22  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
       23  That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
       24  A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
       25  And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
  Direction: Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA
    DESDEMONA
       26  My lord, what is your will?
    OTHELLO
       27  Pray, chuck, come hither.
    DESDEMONA
       28  What is your pleasure?
    OTHELLO
       29  Let me see your eyes;
       30  Look in my face.
    DESDEMONA
       31  What horrible fancy's this?
    OTHELLO
       32  [To EMILIA] Some of your function, mistress;
       33  Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
       34  Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:
       35  Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.
  Direction: Exit EMILIA
    DESDEMONA
       36  Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
       37  I understand a fury in your words.
       38  But not the words.
    OTHELLO
       39  Why, what art thou?
    DESDEMONA
       40  Your wife, my lord; your true
       41  And loyal wife.
    OTHELLO
       42  Come, swear it, damn thyself
       43  Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
       44  Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
       45  Swear thou art honest.
    DESDEMONA
       46  Heaven doth truly know it.
    OTHELLO
       47  Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
    DESDEMONA
       48  To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
    OTHELLO
       49  O Desdemona! away! away! away!
    DESDEMONA
       50  Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
       51  Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
       52  If haply you my father do suspect
       53  An instrument of this your calling back,
       54  Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,
       55  Why, I have lost him too.
    OTHELLO
       56  Had it pleased heaven
       57  To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
       58  All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.
       59  Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
       60  Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
       61  I should have found in some place of my soul
       62  A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me
       63  A fixed figure for the time of scorn
       64  To point his slow unmoving finger at!
       65  Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
       66  But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
       67  Where either I must live, or bear no life;
       68  The fountain from the which my current runs,
       69  Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
       70  Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
       71  To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
       72  Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--
       73  Ay, there, look grim as hell!
    DESDEMONA
       74  I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
    OTHELLO
       75  O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
       76  That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
       77  Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
       78  That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst
       79  ne'er been born!
    DESDEMONA
       80  Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
    OTHELLO
       81  Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
       82  Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
       83  Committed! O thou public commoner!
       84  I should make very forges of my cheeks,
       85  That would to cinders burn up modesty,
       86  Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
       87  Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
       88  The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
       89  Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
       90  And will not hear it. What committed!
       91  Impudent strumpet!
    DESDEMONA
       92  By heaven, you do me wrong.
    OTHELLO
       93  Are you not a strumpet?
    DESDEMONA
       94  No, as I am a Christian:
       95  If to preserve this vessel for my lord
       96  From any other foul unlawful touch
       97  Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
    OTHELLO
       98  What, not a whore?
    DESDEMONA
       99  No, as I shall be saved.
    OTHELLO
      100  Is't possible?
    DESDEMONA
      101  O, heaven forgive us!
    OTHELLO
      102  I cry you mercy, then:
      103  I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
      104  That married with Othello.
  Direction: Raising his voice
      105  You, mistress,
      106  That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
      107  And keep the gate of hell!
  Direction: Re-enter EMILIA
      108  You, you, ay, you!
      109  We have done our course; there's money for your pains:
      110  I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.
  Direction: Exit
    EMILIA
      111  Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
      112  How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?
    DESDEMONA
      113  'Faith, half asleep.
    EMILIA
      114  Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
    DESDEMONA
      115  With who?
    EMILIA
      116  Why, with my lord, madam.
    DESDEMONA
      117  Who is thy lord?
    EMILIA
      118  He that is yours, sweet lady.
    DESDEMONA
      119  I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
      120  I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
      121  But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
      122  Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
      123  And call thy husband hither.
    EMILIA
      124  Here's a change indeed!
  Direction: Exit
    DESDEMONA
      125  'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
      126  How have I been behaved, that he might stick
      127  The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
  Direction: Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO
    IAGO
      128  What is your pleasure, madam?
      129  How is't with you?
    DESDEMONA
      130  I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
      131  Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
      132  He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
      133  I am a child to chiding.
    IAGO
      134  What's the matter, lady?
    EMILIA
      135  Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.
      136  Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
      137  As true hearts cannot bear.
    DESDEMONA
      138  Am I that name, Iago?
    IAGO
      139  What name, fair lady?
    DESDEMONA
      140  Such as she says my lord did say I was.
    EMILIA
      141  He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
      142  Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.
    IAGO
      143  Why did he so?
    DESDEMONA
      144  I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
    IAGO
      145  Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
    EMILIA
      146  Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
      147  Her father and her country and her friends,
      148  To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?
    DESDEMONA
      149  It is my wretched fortune.
    IAGO
      150  Beshrew him for't!
      151  How comes this trick upon him?
    DESDEMONA
      152  Nay, heaven doth know.
    EMILIA
      153  I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
      154  Some busy and insinuating rogue,
      155  Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
      156  Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.
    IAGO
      157  Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
    DESDEMONA
      158  If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
    EMILIA
      159  A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
      160  Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
      161  What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
      162  The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
      163  Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
      164  O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
      165  And put in every honest hand a whip
      166  To lash the rascals naked through the world
      167  Even from the east to the west!
    IAGO
      168  Speak within door.
    EMILIA
      169  O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
      170  That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
      171  And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
    IAGO
      172  You are a fool; go to.
    DESDEMONA
      173  O good Iago,
      174  What shall I do to win my lord again?
      175  Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
      176  I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
      177  If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
      178  Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
      179  Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
      180  Delighted them in any other form;
      181  Or that I do not yet, and ever did.
      182  And ever will--though he do shake me off
      183  To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,
      184  Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
      185  And his unkindness may defeat my life,
      186  But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
      187  It does abhor me now I speak the word;
      188  To do the act that might the addition earn
      189  Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
    IAGO
      190  I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
      191  The business of the state does him offence,
      192  And he does chide with you.
    DESDEMONA
      193  If 'twere no other--
    IAGO
      194  'Tis but so, I warrant.
  Direction: Trumpets within
      195  Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
      196  The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
      197  Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
  Direction: Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
  Direction: Enter RODERIGO
      198  How now, Roderigo!
    RODERIGO
      199  I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
    IAGO
      200  What in the contrary?
    RODERIGO
      201  Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;
      202  and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me
      203  all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
      204  advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
      205  it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
      206  already I have foolishly suffered.
    IAGO
      207  Will you hear me, Roderigo?
    RODERIGO
      208  'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
      209  performances are no kin together.
    IAGO
      210  You charge me most unjustly.
    RODERIGO
      211  With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
      212  my means. The jewels you have had from me to
      213  deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
      214  votarist: you have told me she hath received them
      215  and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
      216  respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
    IAGO
      217  Well; go to; very well.
    RODERIGO
      218  Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis
      219  not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin
      220  to find myself fobbed in it.
    IAGO
      221  Very well.
    RODERIGO
      222  I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
      223  known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
      224  jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
      225  unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
      226  will seek satisfaction of you.
    IAGO
      227  You have said now.
    RODERIGO
      228  Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.
    IAGO
      229  Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
      230  this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
      231  ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
      232  taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
      233  protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
    RODERIGO
      234  It hath not appeared.
    IAGO
      235  I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
      236  suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
      237  Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
      238  have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean
      239  purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
      240  thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
      241  take me from this world with treachery and devise
      242  engines for my life.
    RODERIGO
      243  Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?
    IAGO
      244  Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice
      245  to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
    RODERIGO
      246  Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
      247  return again to Venice.
    IAGO
      248  O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
      249  him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
      250  lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
      251  so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
    RODERIGO
      252  How do you mean, removing of him?
    IAGO
      253  Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;
      254  knocking out his brains.
    RODERIGO
      255  And that you would have me to do?
    IAGO
      256  Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
      257  He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
      258  go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
      259  fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
      260  I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
      261  you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
      262  to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
      263  us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
      264  me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
      265  that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
      266  him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
      267  to waste: about it.
    RODERIGO
      268  I will hear further reason for this.
    IAGO
      269  And you shall be satisfied.
  Direction: Exeunt
