          Othello : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
  Direction: Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen
    MONTANO
        1  What from the cape can you discern at sea?
    First Gentleman
        2  Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
        3  I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
        4  Descry a sail.
    MONTANO
        5  Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
        6  A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
        7  If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
        8  What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
        9  Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
    Second Gentleman
       10  A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
       11  For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
       12  The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
       13  The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
       14  seems to cast water on the burning bear,
       15  And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
       16  I never did like molestation view
       17  On the enchafed flood.
    MONTANO
       18  If that the Turkish fleet
       19  Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:
       20  It is impossible they bear it out.
  Direction: Enter a third Gentleman
    Third Gentleman
       21  News, lads! our wars are done.
       22  The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
       23  That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice
       24  Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
       25  On most part of their fleet.
    MONTANO
       26  How! is this true?
    Third Gentleman
       27  The ship is here put in,
       28  A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
       29  Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
       30  Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,
       31  And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
    MONTANO
       32  I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
    Third Gentleman
       33  But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
       34  Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,
       35  And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
       36  With foul and violent tempest.
    MONTANO
       37  Pray heavens he be;
       38  For I have served him, and the man commands
       39  Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!
       40  As well to see the vessel that's come in
       41  As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
       42  Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
       43  An indistinct regard.
    Third Gentleman
       44  Come, let's do so:
       45  For every minute is expectancy
       46  Of more arrivance.
  Direction: Enter CASSIO
    CASSIO
       47  Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
       48  That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
       49  Give him defence against the elements,
       50  For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.
    MONTANO
       51  Is he well shipp'd?
    CASSIO
       52  His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot
       53  Of very expert and approved allowance;
       54  Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
       55  Stand in bold cure.
  Direction: A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'
  Direction: Enter a fourth Gentleman
    CASSIO
       56  What noise?
    Fourth Gentleman
       57  The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
       58  Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'
    CASSIO
       59  My hopes do shape him for the governor.
  Direction: Guns heard
    Second Gentlemen
       60  They do discharge their shot of courtesy:
       61  Our friends at least.
    CASSIO
       62  I pray you, sir, go forth,
       63  And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.
    Second Gentleman
       64  I shall.
  Direction: Exit
    MONTANO
       65  But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
    CASSIO
       66  Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
       67  That paragons description and wild fame;
       68  One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
       69  And in the essential vesture of creation
       70  Does tire the ingener.
  Direction: Re-enter second Gentleman
       71  How now! who has put in?
    Second Gentleman
       72  'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
    CASSIO
       73  Has had most favourable and happy speed:
       74  Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
       75  The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--
       76  Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
       77  As having sense of beauty, do omit
       78  Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
       79  The divine Desdemona.
    MONTANO
       80  What is she?
    CASSIO
       81  She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
       82  Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
       83  Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
       84  A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
       85  And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
       86  That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
       87  Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
       88  Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
       89  And bring all Cyprus comfort!
  Direction: Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants
       90  O, behold,
       91  The riches of the ship is come on shore!
       92  Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
       93  Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
       94  Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
       95  Enwheel thee round!
    DESDEMONA
       96  I thank you, valiant Cassio.
       97  What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
    CASSIO
       98  He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
       99  But that he's well and will be shortly here.
    DESDEMONA
      100  O, but I fear--How lost you company?
    CASSIO
      101  The great contention of the sea and skies
      102  Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.
  Direction: Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard
    Second Gentleman
      103  They give their greeting to the citadel;
      104  This likewise is a friend.
    CASSIO
      105  See for the news.
  Direction: Exit Gentleman
      106  Good ancient, you are welcome.
  Direction: To EMILIA
      107  Welcome, mistress.
      108  Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
      109  That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
      110  That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
  Direction: Kissing her
    IAGO
      111  Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
      112  As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
      113  You'll have enough.
    DESDEMONA
      114  Alas, she has no speech.
    IAGO
      115  In faith, too much;
      116  I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
      117  Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
      118  She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
      119  And chides with thinking.
    EMILIA
      120  You have little cause to say so.
    IAGO
      121  Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
      122  Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,
      123  Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,
      124  Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.
    DESDEMONA
      125  O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
    IAGO
      126  Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
      127  You rise to play and go to bed to work.
    EMILIA
      128  You shall not write my praise.
    IAGO
      129  No, let me not.
    DESDEMONA
      130  What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
      131  praise me?
    IAGO
      132  O gentle lady, do not put me to't;
      133  For I am nothing, if not critical.
    DESDEMONA
      134  Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?
    IAGO
      135  Ay, madam.
    DESDEMONA
      136  I am not merry; but I do beguile
      137  The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
      138  Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
    IAGO
      139  I am about it; but indeed my invention
      140  Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
      141  It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,
      142  And thus she is deliver'd.
      143  If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
      144  The one's for use, the other useth it.
    DESDEMONA
      145  Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
    IAGO
      146  If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
      147  She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
    DESDEMONA
      148  Worse and worse.
    EMILIA
      149  How if fair and foolish?
    IAGO
      150  She never yet was foolish that was fair;
      151  For even her folly help'd her to an heir.
    DESDEMONA
      152  These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
      153  the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
      154  her that's foul and foolish?
    IAGO
      155  There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
      156  But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
    DESDEMONA
      157  O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
      158  But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
      159  woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
      160  merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
    IAGO
      161  She that was ever fair and never proud,
      162  Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
      163  Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
      164  Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
      165  She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
      166  Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
      167  She that in wisdom never was so frail
      168  To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
      169  She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
      170  See suitors following and not look behind,
      171  She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
    DESDEMONA
      172  To do what?
    IAGO
      173  To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
    DESDEMONA
      174  O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
      175  of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say
      176  you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
      177  counsellor?
    CASSIO
      178  He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in
      179  the soldier than in the scholar.
    IAGO
      180  [Aside] He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,
      181  whisper: with as little a web as this will I
      182  ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
      183  her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
      184  You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
      185  these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had
      186  been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
      187  oft, which now again you are most apt to play the
      188  sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
      189  courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers
      190  to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!
  Direction: Trumpet within
      191  The Moor! I know his trumpet.
    CASSIO
      192  'Tis truly so.
    DESDEMONA
      193  Let's meet him and receive him.
    CASSIO
      194  Lo, where he comes!
  Direction: Enter OTHELLO and Attendants
    OTHELLO
      195  O my fair warrior!
    DESDEMONA
      196  My dear Othello!
    OTHELLO
      197  It gives me wonder great as my content
      198  To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
      199  If after every tempest come such calms,
      200  May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
      201  And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
      202  Olympus-high and duck again as low
      203  As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
      204  'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
      205  My soul hath her content so absolute
      206  That not another comfort like to this
      207  Succeeds in unknown fate.
    DESDEMONA
      208  The heavens forbid
      209  But that our loves and comforts should increase,
      210  Even as our days do grow!
    OTHELLO
      211  Amen to that, sweet powers!
      212  I cannot speak enough of this content;
      213  It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
      214  And this, and this, the greatest discords be
  Direction: Kissing her
      215  That e'er our hearts shall make!
    IAGO
      216  [Aside] O, you are well tuned now!
      217  But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
      218  As honest as I am.
    OTHELLO
      219  Come, let us to the castle.
      220  News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
      221  are drown'd.
      222  How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
      223  Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
      224  I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
      225  I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
      226  In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
      227  Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
      228  Bring thou the master to the citadel;
      229  He is a good one, and his worthiness
      230  Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
      231  Once more, well met at Cyprus.
  Direction: Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants
    IAGO
      232  Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
      233  hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base
      234  men being in love have then a nobility in their
      235  natures more than is native to them--list me. The
      236  lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
      237  guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is
      238  directly in love with him.
    RODERIGO
      239  With him! why, 'tis not possible.
    IAGO
      240  Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
      241  Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
      242  but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
      243  and will she love him still for prating? let not
      244  thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
      245  and what delight shall she have to look on the
      246  devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
      247  sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
      248  give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
      249  sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
      250  the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
      251  required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
      252  find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
      253  disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
      254  instruct her in it and compel her to some second
      255  choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most
      256  pregnant and unforced position--who stands so
      257  eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
      258  does? a knave very voluble; no further
      259  conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
      260  civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
      261  of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
      262  none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
      263  finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
      264  counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
      265  present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
      266  knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
      267  requisites in him that folly and green minds look
      268  after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
      269  hath found him already.
    RODERIGO
      270  I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
      271  most blessed condition.
    IAGO
      272  Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
      273  grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
      274  have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
      275  not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
      276  not mark that?
    RODERIGO
      277  Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
    IAGO
      278  Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
      279  to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
      280  so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
      281  together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
      282  mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
      283  the master and main exercise, the incorporate
      284  conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
      285  have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
      286  for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows
      287  you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
      288  some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
      289  too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
      290  other course you please, which the time shall more
      291  favourably minister.
    RODERIGO
      292  Well.
    IAGO
      293  Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
      294  may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
      295  even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
      296  mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
      297  taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
      298  shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
      299  the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
      300  impediment most profitably removed, without the
      301  which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
    RODERIGO
      302  I will do this, if I can bring it to any
      303  opportunity.
    IAGO
      304  I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
      305  I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.
    RODERIGO
      306  Adieu.
  Direction: Exit
    IAGO
      307  That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
      308  That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
      309  The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
      310  Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
      311  And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
      312  A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
      313  Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
      314  I stand accountant for as great a sin,
      315  But partly led to diet my revenge,
      316  For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
      317  Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
      318  Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
      319  And nothing can or shall content my soul
      320  Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
      321  Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
      322  At least into a jealousy so strong
      323  That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
      324  If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
      325  For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
      326  I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
      327  Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
      328  For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
      329  Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
      330  For making him egregiously an ass
      331  And practising upon his peace and quiet
      332  Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
      333  Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.
  Direction: Exit
