          Othello : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Venice. A street.
  Direction: Enter RODERIGO and IAGO
    RODERIGO
        1  Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
        2  That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
        3  As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
    IAGO
        4  'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
        5  If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.
    RODERIGO
        6  Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
    IAGO
        7  Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
        8  In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
        9  Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
       10  I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
       11  But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
       12  Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
       13  Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
       14  And, in conclusion,
       15  Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
       16  'I have already chose my officer.'
       17  And what was he?
       18  Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
       19  One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
       20  A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
       21  That never set a squadron in the field,
       22  Nor the division of a battle knows
       23  More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
       24  Wherein the toged consuls can propose
       25  As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
       26  Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
       27  And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
       28  At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
       29  Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
       30  By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
       31  He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
       32  And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.
    RODERIGO
       33  By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
    IAGO
       34  Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
       35  Preferment goes by letter and affection,
       36  And not by old gradation, where each second
       37  Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
       38  Whether I in any just term am affined
       39  To love the Moor.
    RODERIGO
       40  I would not follow him then.
    IAGO
       41  O, sir, content you;
       42  I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
       43  We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
       44  Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
       45  Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
       46  That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
       47  Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
       48  For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
       49  Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
       50  Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
       51  Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
       52  And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
       53  Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
       54  their coats
       55  Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
       56  And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
       57  It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
       58  Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
       59  In following him, I follow but myself;
       60  Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
       61  But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
       62  For when my outward action doth demonstrate
       63  The native act and figure of my heart
       64  In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
       65  But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
       66  For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
    RODERIGO
       67  What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
       68  If he can carry't thus!
    IAGO
       69  Call up her father,
       70  Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
       71  Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
       72  And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
       73  Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
       74  Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
       75  As it may lose some colour.
    RODERIGO
       76  Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
    IAGO
       77  Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
       78  As when, by night and negligence, the fire
       79  Is spied in populous cities.
    RODERIGO
       80  What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
    IAGO
       81  Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
       82  Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
       83  Thieves! thieves!
  Direction: BRABANTIO appears above, at a window
    BRABANTIO
       84  What is the reason of this terrible summons?
       85  What is the matter there?
    RODERIGO
       86  Signior, is all your family within?
    IAGO
       87  Are your doors lock'd?
    BRABANTIO
       88  Why, wherefore ask you this?
    IAGO
       89  'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
       90  your gown;
       91  Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
       92  Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
       93  Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
       94  Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
       95  Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
       96  Arise, I say.
    BRABANTIO
       97  What, have you lost your wits?
    RODERIGO
       98  Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
    BRABANTIO
       99  Not I what are you?
    RODERIGO
      100  My name is Roderigo.
    BRABANTIO
      101  The worser welcome:
      102  I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
      103  In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
      104  My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
      105  Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
      106  Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
      107  To start my quiet.
    RODERIGO
      108  Sir, sir, sir,--
    BRABANTIO
      109  But thou must needs be sure
      110  My spirit and my place have in them power
      111  To make this bitter to thee.
    RODERIGO
      112  Patience, good sir.
    BRABANTIO
      113  What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
      114  My house is not a grange.
    RODERIGO
      115  Most grave Brabantio,
      116  In simple and pure soul I come to you.
    IAGO
      117  'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
      118  serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
      119  do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
      120  have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
      121  you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
      122  coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
    BRABANTIO
      123  What profane wretch art thou?
    IAGO
      124  I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
      125  and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
    BRABANTIO
      126  Thou art a villain.
    IAGO
      127  You are--a senator.
    BRABANTIO
      128  This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
    RODERIGO
      129  Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
      130  If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
      131  As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
      132  At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
      133  Transported, with no worse nor better guard
      134  But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
      135  To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
      136  If this be known to you and your allowance,
      137  We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
      138  But if you know not this, my manners tell me
      139  We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
      140  That, from the sense of all civility,
      141  I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
      142  Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
      143  I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
      144  Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
      145  In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
      146  Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
      147  If she be in her chamber or your house,
      148  Let loose on me the justice of the state
      149  For thus deluding you.
    BRABANTIO
      150  Strike on the tinder, ho!
      151  Give me a taper! call up all my people!
      152  This accident is not unlike my dream:
      153  Belief of it oppresses me already.
      154  Light, I say! light!
  Direction: Exit above
    IAGO
      155  Farewell; for I must leave you:
      156  It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
      157  To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--
      158  Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
      159  However this may gall him with some cheque,
      160  Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
      161  With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
      162  Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
      163  Another of his fathom they have none,
      164  To lead their business: in which regard,
      165  Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
      166  Yet, for necessity of present life,
      167  I must show out a flag and sign of love,
      168  Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
      169  Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
      170  And there will I be with him. So, farewell.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches
    BRABANTIO
      171  It is too true an evil: gone she is;
      172  And what's to come of my despised time
      173  Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
      174  Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
      175  With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
      176  How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
      177  Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
      178  Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?
    RODERIGO
      179  Truly, I think they are.
    BRABANTIO
      180  O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
      181  Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
      182  By what you see them act. Is there not charms
      183  By which the property of youth and maidhood
      184  May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
      185  Of some such thing?
    RODERIGO
      186  Yes, sir, I have indeed.
    BRABANTIO
      187  Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
      188  Some one way, some another. Do you know
      189  Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
    RODERIGO
      190  I think I can discover him, if you please,
      191  To get good guard and go along with me.
    BRABANTIO
      192  Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
      193  I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
      194  And raise some special officers of night.
      195  On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.
  Direction: Exeunt
