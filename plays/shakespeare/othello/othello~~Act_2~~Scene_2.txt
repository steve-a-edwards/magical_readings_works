        1  It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant
        2  general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,
        3  importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,
        4  every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,
        5  some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and
        6  revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these
        7  beneficial news, it is the celebration of his
        8  nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be
        9  proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full
       10  liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
       11  till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the
       12  isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!
  Direction: Exeunt
