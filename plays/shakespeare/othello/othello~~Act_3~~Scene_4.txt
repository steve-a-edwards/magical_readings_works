          Othello : Act 3 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Before the castle.
  Direction: Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown
    DESDEMONA
        1  Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
    Clown
        2  I dare not say he lies any where.
    DESDEMONA
        3  Why, man?
    Clown
        4  He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
        5  is stabbing.
    DESDEMONA
        6  Go to: where lodges he?
    Clown
        7  To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
    DESDEMONA
        8  Can any thing be made of this?
    Clown
        9  I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
       10  lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
       11  to lie in mine own throat.
    DESDEMONA
       12  Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?
    Clown
       13  I will catechise the world for him; that is, make
       14  questions, and by them answer.
    DESDEMONA
       15  Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
       16  moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
    Clown
       17  To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and
       18  therefore I will attempt the doing it.
  Direction: Exit
    DESDEMONA
       19  Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
    EMILIA
       20  I know not, madam.
    DESDEMONA
       21  Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
       22  Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
       23  Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
       24  As jealous creatures are, it were enough
       25  To put him to ill thinking.
    EMILIA
       26  Is he not jealous?
    DESDEMONA
       27  Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
       28  Drew all such humours from him.
    EMILIA
       29  Look, where he comes.
    DESDEMONA
       30  I will not leave him now till Cassio
       31  Be call'd to him.
  Direction: Enter OTHELLO
       32  How is't with you, my lord
    OTHELLO
       33  Well, my good lady.
  Direction: Aside
       34  O, hardness to dissemble!--
       35  How do you, Desdemona?
    DESDEMONA
       36  Well, my good lord.
    OTHELLO
       37  Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.
    DESDEMONA
       38  It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.
    OTHELLO
       39  This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
       40  Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
       41  A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
       42  Much castigation, exercise devout;
       43  For here's a young and sweating devil here,
       44  That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
       45  A frank one.
    DESDEMONA
       46  You may, indeed, say so;
       47  For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
    OTHELLO
       48  A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
       49  But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
    DESDEMONA
       50  I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
    OTHELLO
       51  What promise, chuck?
    DESDEMONA
       52  I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
    OTHELLO
       53  I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
       54  Lend me thy handkerchief.
    DESDEMONA
       55  Here, my lord.
    OTHELLO
       56  That which I gave you.
    DESDEMONA
       57  I have it not about me.
    OTHELLO
       58  Not?
    DESDEMONA
       59  No, indeed, my lord.
    OTHELLO
       60  That is a fault.
       61  That handkerchief
       62  Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
       63  She was a charmer, and could almost read
       64  The thoughts of people: she told her, while
       65  she kept it,
       66  'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
       67  Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
       68  Or made gift of it, my father's eye
       69  Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
       70  After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
       71  And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
       72  To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
       73  Make it a darling like your precious eye;
       74  To lose't or give't away were such perdition
       75  As nothing else could match.
    DESDEMONA
       76  Is't possible?
    OTHELLO
       77  'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
       78  A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
       79  The sun to course two hundred compasses,
       80  In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
       81  The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
       82  And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
       83  Conserved of maidens' hearts.
    DESDEMONA
       84  Indeed! is't true?
    OTHELLO
       85  Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
    DESDEMONA
       86  Then would to God that I had never seen't!
    OTHELLO
       87  Ha! wherefore?
    DESDEMONA
       88  Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
    OTHELLO
       89  Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out
       90  o' the way?
    DESDEMONA
       91  Heaven bless us!
    OTHELLO
       92  Say you?
    DESDEMONA
       93  It is not lost; but what an if it were?
    OTHELLO
       94  How!
    DESDEMONA
       95  I say, it is not lost.
    OTHELLO
       96  Fetch't, let me see't.
    DESDEMONA
       97  Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
       98  This is a trick to put me from my suit:
       99  Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
    OTHELLO
      100  Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.
    DESDEMONA
      101  Come, come;
      102  You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
    OTHELLO
      103  The handkerchief!
    DESDEMONA
      104  I pray, talk me of Cassio.
    OTHELLO
      105  The handkerchief!
    DESDEMONA
      106  A man that all his time
      107  Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
      108  Shared dangers with you,--
    OTHELLO
      109  The handkerchief!
    DESDEMONA
      110  In sooth, you are to blame.
    OTHELLO
      111  Away!
  Direction: Exit
    EMILIA
      112  Is not this man jealous?
    DESDEMONA
      113  I ne'er saw this before.
      114  Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
      115  I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
    EMILIA
      116  'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
      117  They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
      118  To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
      119  They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!
  Direction: Enter CASSIO and IAGO
    IAGO
      120  There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
      121  And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.
    DESDEMONA
      122  How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?
    CASSIO
      123  Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
      124  That by your virtuous means I may again
      125  Exist, and be a member of his love
      126  Whom I with all the office of my heart
      127  Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
      128  If my offence be of such mortal kind
      129  That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
      130  Nor purposed merit in futurity,
      131  Can ransom me into his love again,
      132  But to know so must be my benefit;
      133  So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
      134  And shut myself up in some other course,
      135  To fortune's alms.
    DESDEMONA
      136  Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
      137  My advocation is not now in tune;
      138  My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
      139  Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
      140  So help me every spirit sanctified,
      141  As I have spoken for you all my best
      142  And stood within the blank of his displeasure
      143  For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
      144  What I can do I will; and more I will
      145  Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.
    IAGO
      146  Is my lord angry?
    EMILIA
      147  He went hence but now,
      148  And certainly in strange unquietness.
    IAGO
      149  Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
      150  When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
      151  And, like the devil, from his very arm
      152  Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?
      153  Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
      154  There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.
    DESDEMONA
      155  I prithee, do so.
  Direction: Exit IAGO
      156  Something, sure, of state,
      157  Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise
      158  Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
      159  Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
      160  Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
      161  Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
      162  For let our finger ache, and it indues
      163  Our other healthful members even to that sense
      164  Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
      165  Nor of them look for such observances
      166  As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
      167  I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
      168  Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
      169  But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
      170  And he's indicted falsely.
    EMILIA
      171  Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
      172  And no conception nor no jealous toy
      173  Concerning you.
    DESDEMONA
      174  Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
    EMILIA
      175  But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
      176  They are not ever jealous for the cause,
      177  But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
      178  Begot upon itself, born on itself.
    DESDEMONA
      179  Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
    EMILIA
      180  Lady, amen.
    DESDEMONA
      181  I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:
      182  If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
      183  And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
    CASSIO
      184  I humbly thank your ladyship.
  Direction: Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
  Direction: Enter BIANCA
    BIANCA
      185  Save you, friend Cassio!
    CASSIO
      186  What make you from home?
      187  How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
      188  I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
    BIANCA
      189  And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
      190  What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
      191  Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
      192  More tedious than the dial eight score times?
      193  O weary reckoning!
    CASSIO
      194  Pardon me, Bianca:
      195  I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
      196  But I shall, in a more continuate time,
      197  Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,
  Direction: Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief
      198  Take me this work out.
    BIANCA
      199  O Cassio, whence came this?
      200  This is some token from a newer friend:
      201  To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
      202  Is't come to this? Well, well.
    CASSIO
      203  Go to, woman!
      204  Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
      205  From whence you have them. You are jealous now
      206  That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
      207  No, in good troth, Bianca.
    BIANCA
      208  Why, whose is it?
    CASSIO
      209  I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
      210  I like the work well: ere it be demanded--
      211  As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:
      212  Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.
    BIANCA
      213  Leave you! wherefore?
    CASSIO
      214  I do attend here on the general;
      215  And think it no addition, nor my wish,
      216  To have him see me woman'd.
    BIANCA
      217  Why, I pray you?
    CASSIO
      218  Not that I love you not.
    BIANCA
      219  But that you do not love me.
      220  I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
      221  And say if I shall see you soon at night.
    CASSIO
      222  'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
      223  For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.
    BIANCA
      224  'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.
  Direction: Exeunt
