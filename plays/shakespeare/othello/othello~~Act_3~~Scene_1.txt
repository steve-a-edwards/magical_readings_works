          Othello : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Before the castle.
  Direction: Enter CASSIO and some Musicians
    CASSIO
        1  Masters, play here; I will content your pains;
        2  Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'
  Direction: Music
  Direction: Enter Clown
    Clown
        3  Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,
        4  that they speak i' the nose thus?
    First Musician
        5  How, sir, how!
    Clown
        6  Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?
    First Musician
        7  Ay, marry, are they, sir.
    Clown
        8  O, thereby hangs a tail.
    First Musician
        9  Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
    Clown
       10  Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.
       11  But, masters, here's money for you: and the general
       12  so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's
       13  sake, to make no more noise with it.
    First Musician
       14  Well, sir, we will not.
    Clown
       15  If you have any music that may not be heard, to't
       16  again: but, as they say to hear music the general
       17  does not greatly care.
    First Musician
       18  We have none such, sir.
    Clown
       19  Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:
       20  go; vanish into air; away!
  Direction: Exeunt Musicians
    CASSIO
       21  Dost thou hear, my honest friend?
    Clown
       22  No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
    CASSIO
       23  Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece
       24  of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
       25  the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's
       26  one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
       27  wilt thou do this?
    Clown
       28  She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I
       29  shall seem to notify unto her.
    CASSIO
       30  Do, good my friend.
  Direction: Exit Clown
  Direction: Enter IAGO
       31  In happy time, Iago.
    IAGO
       32  You have not been a-bed, then?
    CASSIO
       33  Why, no; the day had broke
       34  Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
       35  To send in to your wife: my suit to her
       36  Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
       37  Procure me some access.
    IAGO
       38  I'll send her to you presently;
       39  And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
       40  Out of the way, that your converse and business
       41  May be more free.
    CASSIO
       42  I humbly thank you for't.
  Direction: Exit IAGO
       43  I never knew
       44  A Florentine more kind and honest.
  Direction: Enter EMILIA
    EMILIA
       45  Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry
       46  For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
       47  The general and his wife are talking of it;
       48  And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
       49  That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
       50  And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
       51  He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
       52  And needs no other suitor but his likings
       53  To take the safest occasion by the front
       54  To bring you in again.
    CASSIO
       55  Yet, I beseech you,
       56  If you think fit, or that it may be done,
       57  Give me advantage of some brief discourse
       58  With Desdemona alone.
    EMILIA
       59  Pray you, come in;
       60  I will bestow you where you shall have time
       61  To speak your bosom freely.
    CASSIO
       62  I am much bound to you.
  Direction: Exeunt
