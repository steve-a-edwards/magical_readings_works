          Othello : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Another street.
  Direction: Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches
    IAGO
        1  Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
        2  Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
        3  To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
        4  Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
        5  I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
    OTHELLO
        6  'Tis better as it is.
    IAGO
        7  Nay, but he prated,
        8  And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
        9  Against your honour
       10  That, with the little godliness I have,
       11  I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
       12  Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
       13  That the magnifico is much beloved,
       14  And hath in his effect a voice potential
       15  As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
       16  Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
       17  The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
       18  Will give him cable.
    OTHELLO
       19  Let him do his spite:
       20  My services which I have done the signiory
       21  Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--
       22  Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
       23  I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being
       24  From men of royal siege, and my demerits
       25  May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
       26  As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
       27  But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
       28  I would not my unhoused free condition
       29  Put into circumscription and confine
       30  For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?
    IAGO
       31  Those are the raised father and his friends:
       32  You were best go in.
    OTHELLO
       33  Not I I must be found:
       34  My parts, my title and my perfect soul
       35  Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
    IAGO
       36  By Janus, I think no.
  Direction: Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches
    OTHELLO
       37  The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.
       38  The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
       39  What is the news?
    CASSIO
       40  The duke does greet you, general,
       41  And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
       42  Even on the instant.
    OTHELLO
       43  What is the matter, think you?
    CASSIO
       44  Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
       45  It is a business of some heat: the galleys
       46  Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
       47  This very night at one another's heels,
       48  And many of the consuls, raised and met,
       49  Are at the duke's already: you have been
       50  hotly call'd for;
       51  When, being not at your lodging to be found,
       52  The senate hath sent about three several guests
       53  To search you out.
    OTHELLO
       54  'Tis well I am found by you.
       55  I will but spend a word here in the house,
       56  And go with you.
  Direction: Exit
    CASSIO
       57  Ancient, what makes he here?
    IAGO
       58  'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
       59  If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.
    CASSIO
       60  I do not understand.
    IAGO
       61  He's married.
    CASSIO
       62  To who?
  Direction: Re-enter OTHELLO
    IAGO
       63  Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?
    OTHELLO
       64  Have with you.
    CASSIO
       65  Here comes another troop to seek for you.
    IAGO
       66  It is Brabantio. General, be advised;
       67  He comes to bad intent.
  Direction: Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons
    OTHELLO
       68  Holla! stand there!
    RODERIGO
       69  Signior, it is the Moor.
    BRABANTIO
       70  Down with him, thief!
  Direction: They draw on both sides
    IAGO
       71  You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.
    OTHELLO
       72  Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
       73  Good signior, you shall more command with years
       74  Than with your weapons.
    BRABANTIO
       75  O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
       76  Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
       77  For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
       78  If she in chains of magic were not bound,
       79  Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
       80  So opposite to marriage that she shunned
       81  The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
       82  Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
       83  Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
       84  Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
       85  Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
       86  That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
       87  Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
       88  That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
       89  'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
       90  I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
       91  For an abuser of the world, a practiser
       92  Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
       93  Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
       94  Subdue him at his peril.
    OTHELLO
       95  Hold your hands,
       96  Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
       97  Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
       98  Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
       99  To answer this your charge?
    BRABANTIO
      100  To prison, till fit time
      101  Of law and course of direct session
      102  Call thee to answer.
    OTHELLO
      103  What if I do obey?
      104  How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
      105  Whose messengers are here about my side,
      106  Upon some present business of the state
      107  To bring me to him?
    First Officer
      108  'Tis true, most worthy signior;
      109  The duke's in council and your noble self,
      110  I am sure, is sent for.
    BRABANTIO
      111  How! the duke in council!
      112  In this time of the night! Bring him away:
      113  Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
      114  Or any of my brothers of the state,
      115  Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
      116  For if such actions may have passage free,
      117  Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
  Direction: Exeunt
