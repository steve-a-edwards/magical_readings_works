    CAPULET
        3  Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
        4  The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
        5  Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
        6  Spare not for the cost.
    Nurse
        7  Go, you cot-quean, go,
        8  Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
        9  For this night's watching.
    CAPULET
       10  No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
       11  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
    LADY CAPULET
       12  Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
       13  But I will watch you from such watching now.
  Direction: Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

       15  Now, fellow,
       16  What's there?
    First Servant
       17  Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
    CAPULET
       18  Make haste, make haste.
  Direction: Exit First Servant
       19  Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
       20  Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
    Second Servant
       21  I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
       22  And never trouble Peter for the matter.
  Direction: Exit
    CAPULET
       23  Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
       24  Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
       25  The county will be here with music straight,
       26  For so he said he would: I hear him near.
  Direction: Music within
       27  Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
  Direction: Re-enter Nurse
       28  Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
       29  I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
       30  Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
       31  Make haste, I say.
  Direction: Exeunt
