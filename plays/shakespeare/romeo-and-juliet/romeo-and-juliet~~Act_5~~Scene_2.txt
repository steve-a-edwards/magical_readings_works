          Romeo And Juliet : Act 5 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
  Direction: Enter FRIAR JOHN
    FRIAR JOHN
        1  Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
  Direction: Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
    FRIAR LAURENCE
        2  This same should be the voice of Friar John.
        3  Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
        4  Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
    FRIAR JOHN
        5  Going to find a bare-foot brother out
        6  One of our order, to associate me,
        7  Here in this city visiting the sick,
        8  And finding him, the searchers of the town,
        9  Suspecting that we both were in a house
       10  Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
       11  Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
       12  So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       13  Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
    FRIAR JOHN
       14  I could not send it,--here it is again,--
       15  Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
       16  So fearful were they of infection.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       17  Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
       18  The letter was not nice but full of charge
       19  Of dear import, and the neglecting it
       20  May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
       21  Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
       22  Unto my cell.
    FRIAR JOHN
       23  Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
  Direction: Exit
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       24  Now must I to the monument alone;
       25  Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
       26  She will beshrew me much that Romeo
       27  Hath had no notice of these accidents;
       28  But I will write again to Mantua,
       29  And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
       30  Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
  Direction: Exit
