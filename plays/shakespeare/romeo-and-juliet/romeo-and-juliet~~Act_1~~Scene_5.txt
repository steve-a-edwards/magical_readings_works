          Romeo And Juliet : Act 1 : Scene 5

SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
  Direction: Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
    First Servant
        1  Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
        2  shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
    Second Servant
        3  When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
        4  hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
    First Servant
        5  Away with the joint-stools, remove the
        6  court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
        7  me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
        8  the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
        9  Antony, and Potpan!
    Second Servant
       10  Ay, boy, ready.
    First Servant
       11  You are looked for and called for, asked for and
       12  sought for, in the great chamber.
    Second Servant
       13  We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
       14  brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
  Direction: Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
    CAPULET
       15  Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
       16  Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
       17  Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
       18  Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
       19  She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
       20  Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
       21  That I have worn a visor and could tell
       22  A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
       23  Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
       24  You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
       25  A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
  Direction: Music plays, and they dance
       26  More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
       27  And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
       28  Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
       29  Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
       30  For you and I are past our dancing days:
       31  How long is't now since last yourself and I
       32  Were in a mask?
    Second Capulet
       33  By'r lady, thirty years.
    CAPULET
       34  What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
       35  'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
       36  Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
       37  Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
    Second Capulet
       38  'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
       39  His son is thirty.
    CAPULET
       40  Will you tell me that?
       41  His son was but a ward two years ago.
    ROMEO
       42  [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
       43  enrich the hand
       44  Of yonder knight?
    Servant
       45  I know not, sir.
    ROMEO
       46  O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
       47  It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
       48  Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
       49  Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
       50  So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
       51  As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
       52  The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
       53  And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
       54  Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
       55  For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
    TYBALT
       56  This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
       57  Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
       58  Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
       59  To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
       60  Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
       61  To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
    CAPULET
       62  Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
    TYBALT
       63  Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
       64  A villain that is hither come in spite,
       65  To scorn at our solemnity this night.
    CAPULET
       66  Young Romeo is it?
    TYBALT
       67  'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
    CAPULET
       68  Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
       69  He bears him like a portly gentleman;
       70  And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
       71  To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
       72  I would not for the wealth of all the town
       73  Here in my house do him disparagement:
       74  Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
       75  It is my will, the which if thou respect,
       76  Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
       77  And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
    TYBALT
       78  It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
       79  I'll not endure him.
    CAPULET
       80  He shall be endured:
       81  What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
       82  Am I the master here, or you? go to.
       83  You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
       84  You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
       85  You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
    TYBALT
       86  Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
    CAPULET
       87  Go to, go to;
       88  You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
       89  This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
       90  You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
       91  Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
       92  Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
       93  I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
    TYBALT
       94  Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
       95  Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
       96  I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
       97  Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
  Direction: Exit
    ROMEO
       98  [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
       99  This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
      100  My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
      101  To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
    JULIET
      102  Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
      103  Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
      104  For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
      105  And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
    ROMEO
      106  Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
    JULIET
      107  Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
    ROMEO
      108  O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
      109  They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
    JULIET
      110  Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
    ROMEO
      111  Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
      112  Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
    JULIET
      113  Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
    ROMEO
      114  Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
      115  Give me my sin again.
    JULIET
      116  You kiss by the book.
    Nurse
      117  Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
    ROMEO
      118  What is her mother?
    Nurse
      119  Marry, bachelor,
      120  Her mother is the lady of the house,
      121  And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
      122  I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
      123  I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
      124  Shall have the chinks.
    ROMEO
      125  Is she a Capulet?
      126  O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
    BENVOLIO
      127  Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
    ROMEO
      128  Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
    CAPULET
      129  Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
      130  We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
      131  Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
      132  I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
      133  More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
      134  Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
      135  I'll to my rest.
  Direction: Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
    JULIET
      136  Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
    Nurse
      137  The son and heir of old Tiberio.
    JULIET
      138  What's he that now is going out of door?
    Nurse
      139  Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
    JULIET
      140  What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
    Nurse
      141  I know not.
    JULIET
      142  Go ask his name: if he be married.
      143  My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
    Nurse
      144  His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
      145  The only son of your great enemy.
    JULIET
      146  My only love sprung from my only hate!
      147  Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
      148  Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
      149  That I must love a loathed enemy.
    Nurse
      150  What's this? what's this?
    JULIET
      151  A rhyme I learn'd even now
      152  Of one I danced withal.
  Direction: One calls within 'Juliet.'
    Nurse
      153  Anon, anon!
      154  Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
  Direction: Exeunt
