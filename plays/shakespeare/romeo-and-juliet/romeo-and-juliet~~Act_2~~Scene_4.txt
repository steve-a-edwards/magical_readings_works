          Romeo And Juliet : Act 2 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. A street.
  Direction: Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
    MERCUTIO
        1  Where the devil should this Romeo be?
        2  Came he not home to-night?
    BENVOLIO
        3  Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
    MERCUTIO
        4  Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
        5  Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
    BENVOLIO
        6  Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
        7  Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
    MERCUTIO
        8  A challenge, on my life.
    BENVOLIO
        9  Romeo will answer it.
    MERCUTIO
       10  Any man that can write may answer a letter.
    BENVOLIO
       11  Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
       12  dares, being dared.
    MERCUTIO
       13  Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
       14  white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
       15  love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
       16  blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
       17  encounter Tybalt?
    BENVOLIO
       18  Why, what is Tybalt?
    MERCUTIO
       19  More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
       20  the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
       21  you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
       22  proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
       23  the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
       24  button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
       25  very first house, of the first and second cause:
       26  ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
       27  hai!
    BENVOLIO
       28  The what?
    MERCUTIO
       29  The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
       30  fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
       31  a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
       32  whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
       33  grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
       34  these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
       35  perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
       36  that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
       37  bones, their bones!
  Direction: Enter ROMEO
    BENVOLIO
       38  Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
    MERCUTIO
       39  Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
       40  how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
       41  that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
       42  kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
       43  be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
       44  Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
       45  eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
       46  Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
       47  to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
       48  fairly last night.
    ROMEO
       49  Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
    MERCUTIO
       50  The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
    ROMEO
       51  Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
       52  such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
    MERCUTIO
       53  That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
       54  constrains a man to bow in the hams.
    ROMEO
       55  Meaning, to court'sy.
    MERCUTIO
       56  Thou hast most kindly hit it.
    ROMEO
       57  A most courteous exposition.
    MERCUTIO
       58  Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
    ROMEO
       59  Pink for flower.
    MERCUTIO
       60  Right.
    ROMEO
       61  Why, then is my pump well flowered.
    MERCUTIO
       62  Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
       63  worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
       64  is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
    ROMEO
       65  O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
       66  singleness.
    MERCUTIO
       67  Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
    ROMEO
       68  Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
    MERCUTIO
       69  Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
       70  done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
       71  thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
       72  was I with you there for the goose?
    ROMEO
       73  Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
       74  not there for the goose.
    MERCUTIO
       75  I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
    ROMEO
       76  Nay, good goose, bite not.
    MERCUTIO
       77  Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
       78  sharp sauce.
    ROMEO
       79  And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
    MERCUTIO
       80  O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
       81  inch narrow to an ell broad!
    ROMEO
       82  I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
       83  to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
    MERCUTIO
       84  Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
       85  now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
       86  thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
       87  for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
       88  that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
    BENVOLIO
       89  Stop there, stop there.
    MERCUTIO
       90  Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
    BENVOLIO
       91  Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
    MERCUTIO
       92  O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
       93  for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
       94  meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
    ROMEO
       95  Here's goodly gear!
  Direction: Enter Nurse and PETER
    MERCUTIO
       96  A sail, a sail!
    BENVOLIO
       97  Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
    Nurse
       98  Peter!
    PETER
       99  Anon!
    Nurse
      100  My fan, Peter.
    MERCUTIO
      101  Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
      102  fairer face.
    Nurse
      103  God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
    MERCUTIO
      104  God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
    Nurse
      105  Is it good den?
    MERCUTIO
      106  'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
      107  dial is now upon the prick of noon.
    Nurse
      108  Out upon you! what a man are you!
    ROMEO
      109  One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
      110  mar.
    Nurse
      111  By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
      112  quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
      113  may find the young Romeo?
    ROMEO
      114  I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
      115  you have found him than he was when you sought him:
      116  I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
    Nurse
      117  You say well.
    MERCUTIO
      118  Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
      119  wisely, wisely.
    Nurse
      120  if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
      121  you.
    BENVOLIO
      122  She will indite him to some supper.
    MERCUTIO
      123  A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
    ROMEO
      124  What hast thou found?
    MERCUTIO
      125  No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
      126  that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
  Direction: Sings
      127  An old hare hoar,
      128  And an old hare hoar,
      129  Is very good meat in lent
      130  But a hare that is hoar
      131  Is too much for a score,
      132  When it hoars ere it be spent.
      133  Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
      134  to dinner, thither.
    ROMEO
      135  I will follow you.
    MERCUTIO
      136  Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
  Direction: Singing
      137  'lady, lady, lady.'
  Direction: Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
    Nurse
      138  Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
      139  merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
    ROMEO
      140  A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
      141  and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
      142  to in a month.
    Nurse
      143  An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
      144  down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
      145  Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
      146  Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
      147  none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
      148  too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
    PETER
      149  I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
      150  should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
      151  draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
      152  good quarrel, and the law on my side.
    Nurse
      153  Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
      154  me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
      155  and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
      156  out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
      157  but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
      158  a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
      159  kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
      160  is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
      161  with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
      162  to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
    ROMEO
      163  Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
      164  protest unto thee--
    Nurse
      165  Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
      166  Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
    ROMEO
      167  What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
    Nurse
      168  I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
      169  I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
    ROMEO
      170  Bid her devise
      171  Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
      172  And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
      173  Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
    Nurse
      174  No truly sir; not a penny.
    ROMEO
      175  Go to; I say you shall.
    Nurse
      176  This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
    ROMEO
      177  And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
      178  Within this hour my man shall be with thee
      179  And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
      180  Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
      181  Must be my convoy in the secret night.
      182  Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
      183  Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
    Nurse
      184  Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
    ROMEO
      185  What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
    Nurse
      186  Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
      187  Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
    ROMEO
      188  I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
    NURSE
      189  Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
      190  Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
      191  is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
      192  lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
      193  see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
      194  sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
      195  man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
      196  as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
      197  rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
    ROMEO
      198  Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
    Nurse
      199  Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
      200  the--No; I know it begins with some other
      201  letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
      202  it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
      203  to hear it.
    ROMEO
      204  Commend me to thy lady.
    Nurse
      205  Ay, a thousand times.
  Direction: Exit Romeo
      206  Peter!
    PETER
      207  Anon!
    Nurse
      208  Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
  Direction: Exeunt
