          Romeo And Juliet : Act 2 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
  Direction: Enter JULIET
    JULIET
        1  The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
        2  In half an hour she promised to return.
        3  Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
        4  O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
        5  Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
        6  Driving back shadows over louring hills:
        7  Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
        8  And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
        9  Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
       10  Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
       11  Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
       12  Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
       13  She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
       14  My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
       15  And his to me:
       16  But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
       17  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
       18  O God, she comes!
  Direction: Enter Nurse and PETER
       19  O honey nurse, what news?
       20  Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
    Nurse
       21  Peter, stay at the gate.
  Direction: Exit PETER
    JULIET
       22  Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
       23  Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
       24  If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
       25  By playing it to me with so sour a face.
    Nurse
       26  I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
       27  Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
    JULIET
       28  I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
       29  Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
    Nurse
       30  Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
       31  Do you not see that I am out of breath?
    JULIET
       32  How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
       33  To say to me that thou art out of breath?
       34  The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
       35  Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
       36  Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
       37  Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
       38  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
    Nurse
       39  Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
       40  how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
       41  face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
       42  all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
       43  though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
       44  past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
       45  but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
       46  ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
    JULIET
       47  No, no: but all this did I know before.
       48  What says he of our marriage? what of that?
    Nurse
       49  Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
       50  It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
       51  My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
       52  Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
       53  To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
    JULIET
       54  I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
       55  Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
    Nurse
       56  Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
       57  courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
       58  warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
    JULIET
       59  Where is my mother! why, she is within;
       60  Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
       61  'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
       62  Where is your mother?'
    Nurse
       63  O God's lady dear!
       64  Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
       65  Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
       66  Henceforward do your messages yourself.
    JULIET
       67  Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
    Nurse
       68  Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
    JULIET
       69  I have.
    Nurse
       70  Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
       71  There stays a husband to make you a wife:
       72  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
       73  They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
       74  Hie you to church; I must another way,
       75  To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
       76  Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
       77  I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
       78  But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
       79  Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
    JULIET
       80  Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
  Direction: Exeunt
