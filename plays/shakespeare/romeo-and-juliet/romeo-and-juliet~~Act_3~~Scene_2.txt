          Romeo And Juliet : Act 3 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
  Direction: Enter JULIET
    JULIET
        1  Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
        2  Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
        3  As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
        4  And bring in cloudy night immediately.
        5  Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
        6  That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
        7  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
        8  Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
        9  By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
       10  It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
       11  Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
       12  And learn me how to lose a winning match,
       13  Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
       14  Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
       15  With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
       16  Think true love acted simple modesty.
       17  Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
       18  For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
       19  Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
       20  Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
       21  Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
       22  Take him and cut him out in little stars,
       23  And he will make the face of heaven so fine
       24  That all the world will be in love with night
       25  And pay no worship to the garish sun.
       26  O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
       27  But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
       28  Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
       29  As is the night before some festival
       30  To an impatient child that hath new robes
       31  And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
       32  And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
       33  But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
  Direction: Enter Nurse, with cords
       34  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
       35  That Romeo bid thee fetch?
    Nurse
       36  Ay, ay, the cords.
  Direction: Throws them down
    JULIET
       37  Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
    Nurse
       38  Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
       39  We are undone, lady, we are undone!
       40  Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
    JULIET
       41  Can heaven be so envious?
    Nurse
       42  Romeo can,
       43  Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
       44  Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
    JULIET
       45  What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
       46  This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
       47  Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
       48  And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
       49  Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
       50  I am not I, if there be such an I;
       51  Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
       52  If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
       53  Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
    Nurse
       54  I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
       55  God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
       56  A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
       57  Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
       58  All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
    JULIET
       59  O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
       60  To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
       61  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
       62  And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
    Nurse
       63  O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
       64  O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
       65  That ever I should live to see thee dead!
    JULIET
       66  What storm is this that blows so contrary?
       67  Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
       68  My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
       69  Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
       70  For who is living, if those two are gone?
    Nurse
       71  Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
       72  Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
    JULIET
       73  O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
    Nurse
       74  It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
    JULIET
       75  O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
       76  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
       77  Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
       78  Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
       79  Despised substance of divinest show!
       80  Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
       81  A damned saint, an honourable villain!
       82  O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
       83  When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
       84  In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
       85  Was ever book containing such vile matter
       86  So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
       87  In such a gorgeous palace!
    Nurse
       88  There's no trust,
       89  No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
       90  All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
       91  Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
       92  These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
       93  Shame come to Romeo!
    JULIET
       94  Blister'd be thy tongue
       95  For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
       96  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
       97  For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
       98  Sole monarch of the universal earth.
       99  O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
    Nurse
      100  Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
    JULIET
      101  Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
      102  Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
      103  When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
      104  But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
      105  That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
      106  Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
      107  Your tributary drops belong to woe,
      108  Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
      109  My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
      110  And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
      111  All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
      112  Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
      113  That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
      114  But, O, it presses to my memory,
      115  Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
      116  'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
      117  That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
      118  Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
      119  Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
      120  Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
      121  And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
      122  Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
      123  Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
      124  Which modern lamentations might have moved?
      125  But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
      126  'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
      127  Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
      128  All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
      129  There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
      130  In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
      131  Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
    Nurse
      132  Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
      133  Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
    JULIET
      134  Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
      135  When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
      136  Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
      137  Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
      138  He made you for a highway to my bed;
      139  But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
      140  Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
      141  And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
    Nurse
      142  Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
      143  To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
      144  Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
      145  I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
    JULIET
      146  O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
      147  And bid him come to take his last farewell.
  Direction: Exeunt
