          Romeo And Juliet : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
  Direction: Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
    FRIAR LAURENCE
        1  On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
    PARIS
        2  My father Capulet will have it so;
        3  And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
        4  You say you do not know the lady's mind:
        5  Uneven is the course, I like it not.
    PARIS
        6  Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
        7  And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
        8  For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
        9  Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
       10  That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
       11  And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
       12  To stop the inundation of her tears;
       13  Which, too much minded by herself alone,
       14  May be put from her by society:
       15  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       16  [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
       17  Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
  Direction: Enter JULIET
    PARIS
       18  Happily met, my lady and my wife!
    JULIET
       19  That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
    PARIS
       20  That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
    JULIET
       21  What must be shall be.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       22  That's a certain text.
    PARIS
       23  Come you to make confession to this father?
    JULIET
       24  To answer that, I should confess to you.
    PARIS
       25  Do not deny to him that you love me.
    JULIET
       26  I will confess to you that I love him.
    PARIS
       27  So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
    JULIET
       28  If I do so, it will be of more price,
       29  Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
    PARIS
       30  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
    JULIET
       31  The tears have got small victory by that;
       32  For it was bad enough before their spite.
    PARIS
       33  Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
    JULIET
       34  That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
       35  And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
    PARIS
       36  Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
    JULIET
       37  It may be so, for it is not mine own.
       38  Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
       39  Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       40  My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
       41  My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
    PARIS
       42  God shield I should disturb devotion!
       43  Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
       44  Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
  Direction: Exit
    JULIET
       45  O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
       46  Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       47  Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
       48  It strains me past the compass of my wits:
       49  I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
       50  On Thursday next be married to this county.
    JULIET
       51  Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
       52  Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
       53  If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
       54  Do thou but call my resolution wise,
       55  And with this knife I'll help it presently.
       56  God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
       57  And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
       58  Shall be the label to another deed,
       59  Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
       60  Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
       61  Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
       62  Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
       63  'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
       64  Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
       65  Which the commission of thy years and art
       66  Could to no issue of true honour bring.
       67  Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
       68  If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       69  Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
       70  Which craves as desperate an execution.
       71  As that is desperate which we would prevent.
       72  If, rather than to marry County Paris,
       73  Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
       74  Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
       75  A thing like death to chide away this shame,
       76  That copest with death himself to scape from it:
       77  And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
    JULIET
       78  O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
       79  From off the battlements of yonder tower;
       80  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
       81  Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
       82  Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
       83  O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
       84  With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
       85  Or bid me go into a new-made grave
       86  And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
       87  Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
       88  And I will do it without fear or doubt,
       89  To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       90  Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
       91  To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
       92  To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
       93  Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
       94  Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
       95  And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
       96  When presently through all thy veins shall run
       97  A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
       98  Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
       99  No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
      100  The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
      101  To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
      102  Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
      103  Each part, deprived of supple government,
      104  Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
      105  And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
      106  Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
      107  And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
      108  Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
      109  To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
      110  Then, as the manner of our country is,
      111  In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
      112  Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
      113  Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
      114  In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
      115  Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
      116  And hither shall he come: and he and I
      117  Will watch thy waking, and that very night
      118  Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
      119  And this shall free thee from this present shame;
      120  If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
      121  Abate thy valour in the acting it.
    JULIET
      122  Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
    FRIAR LAURENCE
      123  Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
      124  In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
      125  To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
    JULIET
      126  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
      127  Farewell, dear father!
  Direction: Exeunt
