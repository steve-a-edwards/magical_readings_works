          Romeo And Juliet : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
  Direction: Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
    SAMPSON
        1  Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
    GREGORY
        2  No, for then we should be colliers.
    SAMPSON
        3  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
    GREGORY
        4  Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
    SAMPSON
        5  I strike quickly, being moved.
    GREGORY
        6  But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
    SAMPSON
        7  A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
    GREGORY
        8  To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
        9  therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
    SAMPSON
       10  A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
       11  take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
    GREGORY
       12  That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
       13  to the wall.
    SAMPSON
       14  True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
       15  are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
       16  Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
       17  to the wall.
    GREGORY
       18  The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
    SAMPSON
       19  'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
       20  have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
       21  maids, and cut off their heads.
    GREGORY
       22  The heads of the maids?
    SAMPSON
       23  Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
       24  take it in what sense thou wilt.
    GREGORY
       25  They must take it in sense that feel it.
    SAMPSON
       26  Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
       27  'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
    GREGORY
       28  'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
       29  hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
       30  two of the house of the Montagues.
    SAMPSON
       31  My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
    GREGORY
       32  How! turn thy back and run?
    SAMPSON
       33  Fear me not.
    GREGORY
       34  No, marry; I fear thee!
    SAMPSON
       35  Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
    GREGORY
       36  I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
       37  they list.
    SAMPSON
       38  Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
       39  which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
  Direction: Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
    ABRAHAM
       40  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
    SAMPSON
       41  I do bite my thumb, sir.
    ABRAHAM
       42  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
    SAMPSON
       43  [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
       44  ay?
    GREGORY
       45  No.
    SAMPSON
       46  No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
       47  bite my thumb, sir.
    GREGORY
       48  Do you quarrel, sir?
    ABRAHAM
       49  Quarrel sir! no, sir.
    SAMPSON
       50  If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
    ABRAHAM
       51  No better.
    SAMPSON
       52  Well, sir.
    GREGORY
       53  Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
    SAMPSON
       54  Yes, better, sir.
    ABRAHAM
       55  You lie.
    SAMPSON
       56  Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
  Direction: They fight
  Direction: Enter BENVOLIO
    BENVOLIO
       57  Part, fools!
       58  Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
  Direction: Beats down their swords
  Direction: Enter TYBALT
    TYBALT
       59  What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
       60  Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
    BENVOLIO
       61  I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
       62  Or manage it to part these men with me.
    TYBALT
       63  What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
       64  As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
       65  Have at thee, coward!
  Direction: They fight
  Direction: Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs
    First Citizen
       66  Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
       67  Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
  Direction: Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
    CAPULET
       68  What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
    LADY CAPULET
       69  A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
    CAPULET
       70  My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
       71  And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
  Direction: Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
    MONTAGUE
       72  Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
    LADY MONTAGUE
       73  Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
  Direction: Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
    PRINCE
       74  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
       75  Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
       76  Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
       77  That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
       78  With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
       79  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
       80  Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
       81  And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
       82  Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
       83  By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
       84  Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
       85  And made Verona's ancient citizens
       86  Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
       87  To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
       88  Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
       89  If ever you disturb our streets again,
       90  Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
       91  For this time, all the rest depart away:
       92  You Capulet; shall go along with me:
       93  And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
       94  To know our further pleasure in this case,
       95  To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
       96  Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
  Direction: Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
    MONTAGUE
       97  Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
       98  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
    BENVOLIO
       99  Here were the servants of your adversary,
      100  And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
      101  I drew to part them: in the instant came
      102  The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
      103  Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
      104  He swung about his head and cut the winds,
      105  Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
      106  While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
      107  Came more and more and fought on part and part,
      108  Till the prince came, who parted either part.
    LADY MONTAGUE
      109  O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
      110  Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
    BENVOLIO
      111  Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
      112  Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
      113  A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
      114  Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
      115  That westward rooteth from the city's side,
      116  So early walking did I see your son:
      117  Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
      118  And stole into the covert of the wood:
      119  I, measuring his affections by my own,
      120  That most are busied when they're most alone,
      121  Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
      122  And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
    MONTAGUE
      123  Many a morning hath he there been seen,
      124  With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
      125  Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
      126  But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
      127  Should in the furthest east begin to draw
      128  The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
      129  Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
      130  And private in his chamber pens himself,
      131  Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
      132  And makes himself an artificial night:
      133  Black and portentous must this humour prove,
      134  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
    BENVOLIO
      135  My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
    MONTAGUE
      136  I neither know it nor can learn of him.
    BENVOLIO
      137  Have you importuned him by any means?
    MONTAGUE
      138  Both by myself and many other friends:
      139  But he, his own affections' counsellor,
      140  Is to himself--I will not say how true--
      141  But to himself so secret and so close,
      142  So far from sounding and discovery,
      143  As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
      144  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
      145  Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
      146  Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
      147  We would as willingly give cure as know.
  Direction: Enter ROMEO
    BENVOLIO
      148  See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
      149  I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
    MONTAGUE
      150  I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
      151  To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
  Direction: Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
    BENVOLIO
      152  Good-morrow, cousin.
    ROMEO
      153  Is the day so young?
    BENVOLIO
      154  But new struck nine.
    ROMEO
      155  Ay me! sad hours seem long.
      156  Was that my father that went hence so fast?
    BENVOLIO
      157  It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
    ROMEO
      158  Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
    BENVOLIO
      159  In love?
    ROMEO
      160  Out--
    BENVOLIO
      161  Of love?
    ROMEO
      162  Out of her favour, where I am in love.
    BENVOLIO
      163  Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
      164  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
    ROMEO
      165  Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
      166  Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
      167  Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
      168  Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
      169  Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
      170  Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
      171  O any thing, of nothing first create!
      172  O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
      173  Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
      174  Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
      175  sick health!
      176  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
      177  This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
      178  Dost thou not laugh?
    BENVOLIO
      179  No, coz, I rather weep.
    ROMEO
      180  Good heart, at what?
    BENVOLIO
      181  At thy good heart's oppression.
    ROMEO
      182  Why, such is love's transgression.
      183  Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
      184  Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
      185  With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
      186  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
      187  Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
      188  Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
      189  Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
      190  What is it else? a madness most discreet,
      191  A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
      192  Farewell, my coz.
    BENVOLIO
      193  Soft! I will go along;
      194  An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
    ROMEO
      195  Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
      196  This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
    BENVOLIO
      197  Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
    ROMEO
      198  What, shall I groan and tell thee?
    BENVOLIO
      199  Groan! why, no.
      200  But sadly tell me who.
    ROMEO
      201  Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
      202  Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
      203  In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
    BENVOLIO
      204  I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
    ROMEO
      205  A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
    BENVOLIO
      206  A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
    ROMEO
      207  Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
      208  With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
      209  And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
      210  From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
      211  She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
      212  Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
      213  Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
      214  O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
      215  That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
    BENVOLIO
      216  Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
    ROMEO
      217  She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
      218  For beauty starved with her severity
      219  Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
      220  She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
      221  To merit bliss by making me despair:
      222  She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
      223  Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
    BENVOLIO
      224  Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
    ROMEO
      225  O, teach me how I should forget to think.
    BENVOLIO
      226  By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
      227  Examine other beauties.
    ROMEO
      228  'Tis the way
      229  To call hers exquisite, in question more:
      230  These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
      231  Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
      232  He that is strucken blind cannot forget
      233  The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
      234  Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
      235  What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
      236  Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
      237  Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
    BENVOLIO
      238  I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
  Direction: Exeunt
