          Romeo And Juliet : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
  Direction: Enter ROMEO
    ROMEO
        1  He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
  Direction: JULIET appears above at a window
        2  But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
        3  It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
        4  Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
        5  Who is already sick and pale with grief,
        6  That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
        7  Be not her maid, since she is envious;
        8  Her vestal livery is but sick and green
        9  And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
       10  It is my lady, O, it is my love!
       11  O, that she knew she were!
       12  She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
       13  Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
       14  I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
       15  Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
       16  Having some business, do entreat her eyes
       17  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
       18  What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
       19  The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
       20  As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
       21  Would through the airy region stream so bright
       22  That birds would sing and think it were not night.
       23  See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
       24  O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
       25  That I might touch that cheek!
    JULIET
       26  Ay me!
    ROMEO
       27  She speaks:
       28  O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
       29  As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
       30  As is a winged messenger of heaven
       31  Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
       32  Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
       33  When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
       34  And sails upon the bosom of the air.
    JULIET
       35  O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
       36  Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
       37  Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
       38  And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
    ROMEO
       39  [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
    JULIET
       40  'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
       41  Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
       42  What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
       43  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
       44  Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
       45  What's in a name? that which we call a rose
       46  By any other name would smell as sweet;
       47  So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
       48  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
       49  Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
       50  And for that name which is no part of thee
       51  Take all myself.
    ROMEO
       52  I take thee at thy word:
       53  Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
       54  Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
    JULIET
       55  What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
       56  So stumblest on my counsel?
    ROMEO
       57  By a name
       58  I know not how to tell thee who I am:
       59  My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
       60  Because it is an enemy to thee;
       61  Had I it written, I would tear the word.
    JULIET
       62  My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
       63  Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
       64  Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
    ROMEO
       65  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
    JULIET
       66  How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
       67  The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
       68  And the place death, considering who thou art,
       69  If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
    ROMEO
       70  With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
       71  For stony limits cannot hold love out,
       72  And what love can do that dares love attempt;
       73  Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
    JULIET
       74  If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
    ROMEO
       75  Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
       76  Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
       77  And I am proof against their enmity.
    JULIET
       78  I would not for the world they saw thee here.
    ROMEO
       79  I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
       80  And but thou love me, let them find me here:
       81  My life were better ended by their hate,
       82  Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
    JULIET
       83  By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
    ROMEO
       84  By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
       85  He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
       86  I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
       87  As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
       88  I would adventure for such merchandise.
    JULIET
       89  Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
       90  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
       91  For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
       92  Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
       93  What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
       94  Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
       95  And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
       96  Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
       97  Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
       98  If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
       99  Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
      100  I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
      101  So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
      102  In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
      103  And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
      104  But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
      105  Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
      106  I should have been more strange, I must confess,
      107  But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
      108  My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
      109  And not impute this yielding to light love,
      110  Which the dark night hath so discovered.
    ROMEO
      111  Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
      112  That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
    JULIET
      113  O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
      114  That monthly changes in her circled orb,
      115  Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
    ROMEO
      116  What shall I swear by?
    JULIET
      117  Do not swear at all;
      118  Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
      119  Which is the god of my idolatry,
      120  And I'll believe thee.
    ROMEO
      121  If my heart's dear love--
    JULIET
      122  Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
      123  I have no joy of this contract to-night:
      124  It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
      125  Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
      126  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
      127  This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
      128  May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
      129  Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
      130  Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
    ROMEO
      131  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
    JULIET
      132  What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
    ROMEO
      133  The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
    JULIET
      134  I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
      135  And yet I would it were to give again.
    ROMEO
      136  Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
    JULIET
      137  But to be frank, and give it thee again.
      138  And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
      139  My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
      140  My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
      141  The more I have, for both are infinite.
  Direction: Nurse calls within
      142  I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
      143  Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
      144  Stay but a little, I will come again.
  Direction: Exit, above
    ROMEO
      145  O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
      146  Being in night, all this is but a dream,
      147  Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
  Direction: Re-enter JULIET, above
    JULIET
      148  Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
      149  If that thy bent of love be honourable,
      150  Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
      151  By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
      152  Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
      153  And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
      154  And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
    Nurse
      155  [Within] Madam!
    JULIET
      156  I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
      157  I do beseech thee--
    Nurse
      158  [Within] Madam!
    JULIET
      159  By and by, I come:--
      160  To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
      161  To-morrow will I send.
    ROMEO
      162  So thrive my soul--
    JULIET
      163  A thousand times good night!
  Direction: Exit, above
    ROMEO
      164  A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
      165  Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
      166  their books,
      167  But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
  Direction: Retiring
  Direction: Re-enter JULIET, above
    JULIET
      168  Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
      169  To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
      170  Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
      171  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
      172  And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
      173  With repetition of my Romeo's name.
    ROMEO
      174  It is my soul that calls upon my name:
      175  How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
      176  Like softest music to attending ears!
    JULIET
      177  Romeo!
    ROMEO
      178  My dear?
    JULIET
      179  At what o'clock to-morrow
      180  Shall I send to thee?
    ROMEO
      181  At the hour of nine.
    JULIET
      182  I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
      183  I have forgot why I did call thee back.
    ROMEO
      184  Let me stand here till thou remember it.
    JULIET
      185  I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
      186  Remembering how I love thy company.
    ROMEO
      187  And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
      188  Forgetting any other home but this.
    JULIET
      189  'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
      190  And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
      191  Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
      192  Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
      193  And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
      194  So loving-jealous of his liberty.
    ROMEO
      195  I would I were thy bird.
    JULIET
      196  Sweet, so would I:
      197  Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
      198  Good night, good night! parting is such
      199  sweet sorrow,
      200  That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
  Direction: Exit above
    ROMEO
      201  Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
      202  Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
      203  Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
      204  His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
  Direction: Exit
