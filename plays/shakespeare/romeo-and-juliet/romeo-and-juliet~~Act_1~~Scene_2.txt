          Romeo And Juliet : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A street.
  Direction: Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
    CAPULET
        1  But Montague is bound as well as I,
        2  In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
        3  For men so old as we to keep the peace.
    PARIS
        4  Of honourable reckoning are you both;
        5  And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
        6  But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
    CAPULET
        7  But saying o'er what I have said before:
        8  My child is yet a stranger in the world;
        9  She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
       10  Let two more summers wither in their pride,
       11  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
    PARIS
       12  Younger than she are happy mothers made.
    CAPULET
       13  And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
       14  The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
       15  She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
       16  But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
       17  My will to her consent is but a part;
       18  An she agree, within her scope of choice
       19  Lies my consent and fair according voice.
       20  This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
       21  Whereto I have invited many a guest,
       22  Such as I love; and you, among the store,
       23  One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
       24  At my poor house look to behold this night
       25  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
       26  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
       27  When well-apparell'd April on the heel
       28  Of limping winter treads, even such delight
       29  Among fresh female buds shall you this night
       30  Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
       31  And like her most whose merit most shall be:
       32  Which on more view, of many mine being one
       33  May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
       34  Come, go with me.
  Direction: To Servant, giving a paper
       35  Go, sirrah, trudge about
       36  Through fair Verona; find those persons out
       37  Whose names are written there, and to them say,
       38  My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
  Direction: Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
    Servant
       39  Find them out whose names are written here! It is
       40  written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
       41  yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
       42  his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
       43  sent to find those persons whose names are here
       44  writ, and can never find what names the writing
       45  person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
  Direction: Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
    BENVOLIO
       46  Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
       47  One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
       48  Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
       49  One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
       50  Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
       51  And the rank poison of the old will die.
    ROMEO
       52  Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
    BENVOLIO
       53  For what, I pray thee?
    ROMEO
       54  For your broken shin.
    BENVOLIO
       55  Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
    ROMEO
       56  Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
       57  Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
       58  Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
    Servant
       59  God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
    ROMEO
       60  Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
    Servant
       61  Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
       62  pray, can you read any thing you see?
    ROMEO
       63  Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
    Servant
       64  Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
    ROMEO
       65  Stay, fellow; I can read.
  Direction: Reads
       66  'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
       67  County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
       68  widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
       69  nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
       70  uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
       71  Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
       72  Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
       73  assembly: whither should they come?
    Servant
       74  Up.
    ROMEO
       75  Whither?
    Servant
       76  To supper; to our house.
    ROMEO
       77  Whose house?
    Servant
       78  My master's.
    ROMEO
       79  Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
    Servant
       80  Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
       81  great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
       82  of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
       83  Rest you merry!
  Direction: Exit
    BENVOLIO
       84  At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
       85  Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
       86  With all the admired beauties of Verona:
       87  Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
       88  Compare her face with some that I shall show,
       89  And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
    ROMEO
       90  When the devout religion of mine eye
       91  Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
       92  And these, who often drown'd could never die,
       93  Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
       94  One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
       95  Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
    BENVOLIO
       96  Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
       97  Herself poised with herself in either eye:
       98  But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
       99  Your lady's love against some other maid
      100  That I will show you shining at this feast,
      101  And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
    ROMEO
      102  I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
      103  But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
  Direction: Exeunt
