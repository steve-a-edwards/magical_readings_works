          Romeo And Juliet : Act 1 : Scene 0

PROLOGUE.The town of Verona
    PROLOGUE
        1  Two households, both alike in dignity,
        2  In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
        3  From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
        4  Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
        5  From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
        6  A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
        7  Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
        8  Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
        9  The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
       10  And the continuance of their parents' rage,
       11  Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
       12  Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
       13  The which if you with patient ears attend,
       14  What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
