          Romeo And Juliet : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A public place.
  Direction: Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
    BENVOLIO
        1  I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
        2  The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
        3  And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
        4  For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
    MERCUTIO
        5  Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
        6  enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
        7  upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
        8  thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
        9  it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
    BENVOLIO
       10  Am I like such a fellow?
    MERCUTIO
       11  Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
       12  any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
       13  soon moody to be moved.
    BENVOLIO
       14  And what to?
    MERCUTIO
       15  Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
       16  shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
       17  thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
       18  or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
       19  wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
       20  other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
       21  eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
       22  Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
       23  meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
       24  an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
       25  man for coughing in the street, because he hath
       26  wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
       27  didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
       28  his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
       29  tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
       30  wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
    BENVOLIO
       31  An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
       32  should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
    MERCUTIO
       33  The fee-simple! O simple!
    BENVOLIO
       34  By my head, here come the Capulets.
    MERCUTIO
       35  By my heel, I care not.
  Direction: Enter TYBALT and others
    TYBALT
       36  Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
       37  Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
    MERCUTIO
       38  And but one word with one of us? couple it with
       39  something; make it a word and a blow.
    TYBALT
       40  You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
       41  will give me occasion.
    MERCUTIO
       42  Could you not take some occasion without giving?
    TYBALT
       43  Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
    MERCUTIO
       44  Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
       45  thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
       46  discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
       47  make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
    BENVOLIO
       48  We talk here in the public haunt of men:
       49  Either withdraw unto some private place,
       50  And reason coldly of your grievances,
       51  Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
    MERCUTIO
       52  Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
       53  I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
  Direction: Enter ROMEO
    TYBALT
       54  Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
    MERCUTIO
       55  But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
       56  Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
       57  Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
    TYBALT
       58  Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
       59  No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
    ROMEO
       60  Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
       61  Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
       62  To such a greeting: villain am I none;
       63  Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
    TYBALT
       64  Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
       65  That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
    ROMEO
       66  I do protest, I never injured thee,
       67  But love thee better than thou canst devise,
       68  Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
       69  And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
       70  As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
    MERCUTIO
       71  O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
       72  Alla stoccata carries it away.
  Direction: Draws
       73  Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
    TYBALT
       74  What wouldst thou have with me?
    MERCUTIO
       75  Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
       76  lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
       77  shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
       78  eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
       79  by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
       80  ears ere it be out.
    TYBALT
       81  I am for you.
  Direction: Drawing
    ROMEO
       82  Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
    MERCUTIO
       83  Come, sir, your passado.
  Direction: They fight
    ROMEO
       84  Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
       85  Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
       86  Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
       87  Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
       88  Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
  Direction: TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
    MERCUTIO
       89  I am hurt.
       90  A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
       91  Is he gone, and hath nothing?
    BENVOLIO
       92  What, art thou hurt?
    MERCUTIO
       93  Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
       94  Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
  Direction: Exit Page
    ROMEO
       95  Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
    MERCUTIO
       96  No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
       97  church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
       98  me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
       99  am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
      100  both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
      101  cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
      102  rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
      103  arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
      104  was hurt under your arm.
    ROMEO
      105  I thought all for the best.
    MERCUTIO
      106  Help me into some house, Benvolio,
      107  Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
      108  They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
      109  And soundly too: your houses!
  Direction: Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
    ROMEO
      110  This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
      111  My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
      112  In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
      113  With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
      114  Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
      115  Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
      116  And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
  Direction: Re-enter BENVOLIO
    BENVOLIO
      117  O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
      118  That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
      119  Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
    ROMEO
      120  This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
      121  This but begins the woe, others must end.
    BENVOLIO
      122  Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
    ROMEO
      123  Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
      124  Away to heaven, respective lenity,
      125  And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
  Direction: Re-enter TYBALT
      126  Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
      127  That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
      128  Is but a little way above our heads,
      129  Staying for thine to keep him company:
      130  Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
    TYBALT
      131  Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
      132  Shalt with him hence.
    ROMEO
      133  This shall determine that.
  Direction: They fight; TYBALT falls
    BENVOLIO
      134  Romeo, away, be gone!
      135  The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
      136  Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
      137  If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
    ROMEO
      138  O, I am fortune's fool!
    BENVOLIO
      139  Why dost thou stay?
  Direction: Exit ROMEO
  Direction: Enter Citizens, and c
    First Citizen
      140  Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
      141  Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
    BENVOLIO
      142  There lies that Tybalt.
    First Citizen
      143  Up, sir, go with me;
      144  I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
  Direction: Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
    PRINCE
      145  Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
    BENVOLIO
      146  O noble prince, I can discover all
      147  The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
      148  There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
      149  That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
    LADY CAPULET
      150  Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
      151  O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
      152  O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
      153  For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
      154  O cousin, cousin!
    PRINCE
      155  Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
    BENVOLIO
      156  Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
      157  Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
      158  How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
      159  Your high displeasure: all this uttered
      160  With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
      161  Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
      162  Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
      163  With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
      164  Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
      165  And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
      166  Cold death aside, and with the other sends
      167  It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
      168  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
      169  'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
      170  his tongue,
      171  His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
      172  And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
      173  An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
      174  Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
      175  But by and by comes back to Romeo,
      176  Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
      177  And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
      178  Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
      179  And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
      180  This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
    LADY CAPULET
      181  He is a kinsman to the Montague;
      182  Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
      183  Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
      184  And all those twenty could but kill one life.
      185  I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
      186  Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
    PRINCE
      187  Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
      188  Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
    MONTAGUE
      189  Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
      190  His fault concludes but what the law should end,
      191  The life of Tybalt.
    PRINCE
      192  And for that offence
      193  Immediately we do exile him hence:
      194  I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
      195  My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
      196  But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
      197  That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
      198  I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
      199  Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
      200  Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
      201  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
      202  Bear hence this body and attend our will:
      203  Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
  Direction: Exeunt
