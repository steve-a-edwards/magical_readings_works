          Romeo And Juliet : Act 3 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
  Direction: Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
    CAPULET
        1  Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
        2  That we have had no time to move our daughter:
        3  Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
        4  And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
        5  'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
        6  I promise you, but for your company,
        7  I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
    PARIS
        8  These times of woe afford no time to woo.
        9  Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
    LADY CAPULET
       10  I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
       11  To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
    CAPULET
       12  Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
       13  Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
       14  In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
       15  Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
       16  Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
       17  And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
       18  But, soft! what day is this?
    PARIS
       19  Monday, my lord,
    CAPULET
       20  Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
       21  O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
       22  She shall be married to this noble earl.
       23  Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
       24  We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
       25  For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
       26  It may be thought we held him carelessly,
       27  Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
       28  Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
       29  And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
    PARIS
       30  My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
    CAPULET
       31  Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
       32  Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
       33  Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
       34  Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
       35  Afore me! it is so very very late,
       36  That we may call it early by and by.
       37  Good night.
  Direction: Exeunt
