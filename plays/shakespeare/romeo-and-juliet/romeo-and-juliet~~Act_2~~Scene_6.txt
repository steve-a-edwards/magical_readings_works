          Romeo And Juliet : Act 2 : Scene 6

SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
  Direction: Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
    FRIAR LAURENCE
        1  So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
        2  That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
    ROMEO
        3  Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
        4  It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
        5  That one short minute gives me in her sight:
        6  Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
        7  Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
        8  It is enough I may but call her mine.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
        9  These violent delights have violent ends
       10  And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
       11  Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
       12  Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
       13  And in the taste confounds the appetite:
       14  Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
       15  Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
  Direction: Enter JULIET
       16  Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
       17  Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
       18  A lover may bestride the gossamer
       19  That idles in the wanton summer air,
       20  And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
    JULIET
       21  Good even to my ghostly confessor.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       22  Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
    JULIET
       23  As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
    ROMEO
       24  Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
       25  Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
       26  To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
       27  This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
       28  Unfold the imagined happiness that both
       29  Receive in either by this dear encounter.
    JULIET
       30  Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
       31  Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
       32  They are but beggars that can count their worth;
       33  But my true love is grown to such excess
       34  I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       35  Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
       36  For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
       37  Till holy church incorporate two in one.
  Direction: Exeunt
