          Romeo And Juliet : Act 2 : Scene 0

PROLOGUE.Verona
  Direction: Enter Chorus
    Chorus
        1  Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
        2  And young affection gapes to be his heir;
        3  That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
        4  With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
        5  Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
        6  Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
        7  But to his foe supposed he must complain,
        8  And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
        9  Being held a foe, he may not have access
       10  To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
       11  And she as much in love, her means much less
       12  To meet her new-beloved any where:
       13  But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
       14  Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
