          Romeo And Juliet : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
  Direction: Enter ROMEO
    ROMEO
        1  Can I go forward when my heart is here?
        2  Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
  Direction: He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
  Direction: Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
    BENVOLIO
        3  Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
    MERCUTIO
        4  He is wise;
        5  And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
    BENVOLIO
        6  He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
        7  Call, good Mercutio.
    MERCUTIO
        8  Nay, I'll conjure too.
        9  Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
       10  Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
       11  Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
       12  Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
       13  Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
       14  One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
       15  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
       16  When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
       17  He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
       18  The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
       19  I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
       20  By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
       21  By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
       22  And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
       23  That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
    BENVOLIO
       24  And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
    MERCUTIO
       25  This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
       26  To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
       27  Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
       28  Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
       29  That were some spite: my invocation
       30  Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
       31  I conjure only but to raise up him.
    BENVOLIO
       32  Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
       33  To be consorted with the humorous night:
       34  Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
    MERCUTIO
       35  If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
       36  Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
       37  And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
       38  As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
       39  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
       40  An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
       41  Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
       42  This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
       43  Come, shall we go?
    BENVOLIO
       44  Go, then; for 'tis in vain
       45  To seek him here that means not to be found.
  Direction: Exeunt
