          Romeo And Juliet : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
  Direction: Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
    CAPULET
        1  So many guests invite as here are writ.
  Direction: Exit First Servant
        2  Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
    Second Servant
        3  You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
        4  can lick their fingers.
    CAPULET
        5  How canst thou try them so?
    Second Servant
        6  Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
        7  own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
        8  fingers goes not with me.
    CAPULET
        9  Go, be gone.
  Direction: Exit Second Servant
       10  We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
       11  What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
    Nurse
       12  Ay, forsooth.
    CAPULET
       13  Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
       14  A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
    Nurse
       15  See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
  Direction: Enter JULIET
    CAPULET
       16  How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
    JULIET
       17  Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
       18  Of disobedient opposition
       19  To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
       20  By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
       21  And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
       22  Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
    CAPULET
       23  Send for the county; go tell him of this:
       24  I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
    JULIET
       25  I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
       26  And gave him what becomed love I might,
       27  Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
    CAPULET
       28  Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
       29  This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
       30  Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
       31  Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
       32  Our whole city is much bound to him.
    JULIET
       33  Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
       34  To help me sort such needful ornaments
       35  As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
    LADY CAPULET
       36  No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
    CAPULET
       37  Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
  Direction: Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
    LADY CAPULET
       38  We shall be short in our provision:
       39  'Tis now near night.
    CAPULET
       40  Tush, I will stir about,
       41  And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
       42  Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
       43  I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
       44  I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
       45  They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
       46  To County Paris, to prepare him up
       47  Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
       48  Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
  Direction: Exeunt
