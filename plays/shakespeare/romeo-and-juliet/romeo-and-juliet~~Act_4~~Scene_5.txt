          Romeo And Juliet : Act 4 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.
  Direction: Enter Nurse
    Nurse
        1  Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
        2  Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
        3  Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
        4  What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
        5  Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
        6  The County Paris hath set up his rest,
        7  That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
        8  Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
        9  I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
       10  Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
       11  He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
  Direction: Undraws the curtains
       12  What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
       13  I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
       14  Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
       15  O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
       16  Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
  Direction: Enter LADY CAPULET
    LADY CAPULET
       17  What noise is here?
    Nurse
       18  O lamentable day!
    LADY CAPULET
       19  What is the matter?
    Nurse
       20  Look, look! O heavy day!
    LADY CAPULET
       21  O me, O me! My child, my only life,
       22  Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
       23  Help, help! Call help.
  Direction: Enter CAPULET
    CAPULET
       24  For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
    Nurse
       25  She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
    LADY CAPULET
       26  Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
    CAPULET
       27  Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
       28  Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
       29  Life and these lips have long been separated:
       30  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
       31  Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
    Nurse
       32  O lamentable day!
    LADY CAPULET
       33  O woful time!
    CAPULET
       34  Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
       35  Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
  Direction: Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       36  Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
    CAPULET
       37  Ready to go, but never to return.
       38  O son! the night before thy wedding-day
       39  Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
       40  Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
       41  Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
       42  My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
       43  And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
    PARIS
       44  Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
       45  And doth it give me such a sight as this?
    LADY CAPULET
       46  Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
       47  Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
       48  In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
       49  But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
       50  But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
       51  And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
    Nurse
       52  O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
       53  Most lamentable day, most woful day,
       54  That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
       55  O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
       56  Never was seen so black a day as this:
       57  O woful day, O woful day!
    PARIS
       58  Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
       59  Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
       60  By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
       61  O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
    CAPULET
       62  Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
       63  Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
       64  To murder, murder our solemnity?
       65  O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
       66  Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
       67  And with my child my joys are buried.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       68  Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
       69  In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
       70  Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
       71  And all the better is it for the maid:
       72  Your part in her you could not keep from death,
       73  But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
       74  The most you sought was her promotion;
       75  For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
       76  And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
       77  Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
       78  O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
       79  That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
       80  She's not well married that lives married long;
       81  But she's best married that dies married young.
       82  Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
       83  On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
       84  In all her best array bear her to church:
       85  For though fond nature bids us an lament,
       86  Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
    CAPULET
       87  All things that we ordained festival,
       88  Turn from their office to black funeral;
       89  Our instruments to melancholy bells,
       90  Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
       91  Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
       92  Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
       93  And all things change them to the contrary.
    FRIAR LAURENCE
       94  Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
       95  And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
       96  To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
       97  The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
       98  Move them no more by crossing their high will.
  Direction: Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE
    First Musician
       99  Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
    Nurse
      100  Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
      101  For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
  Direction: Exit
    First Musician
      102  Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
  Direction: Enter PETER
    PETER
      103  Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
      104  ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
    First Musician
      105  Why 'Heart's ease?'
    PETER
      106  O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
      107  heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
      108  to comfort me.
    First Musician
      109  Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
    PETER
      110  You will not, then?
    First Musician
      111  No.
    PETER
      112  I will then give it you soundly.
    First Musician
      113  What will you give us?
    PETER
      114  No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
      115  I will give you the minstrel.
    First Musician
      116  Then I will give you the serving-creature.
    PETER
      117  Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
      118  your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
      119  I'll fa you; do you note me?
    First Musician
      120  An you re us and fa us, you note us.
    Second Musician
      121  Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
    PETER
      122  Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
      123  with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
      124  me like men:
      125  'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
      126  And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
      127  Then music with her silver sound'--
      128  why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
      129  sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
    Musician
      130  Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
    PETER
      131  Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
    Second Musician
      132  I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
    PETER
      133  Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
    Third Musician
      134  Faith, I know not what to say.
    PETER
      135  O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
      136  for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
      137  because musicians have no gold for sounding:
      138  'Then music with her silver sound
      139  With speedy help doth lend redress.'
  Direction: Exit
    First Musician
      140  What a pestilent knave is this same!
    Second Musician
      141  Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
      142  mourners, and stay dinner.
  Direction: Exeunt
