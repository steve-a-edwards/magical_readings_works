          Romeo And Juliet : Act 3 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
  Direction: Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
    JULIET
        1  Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
        2  It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
        3  That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
        4  Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
        5  Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
    ROMEO
        6  It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
        7  No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
        8  Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
        9  Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
       10  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
       11  I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
    JULIET
       12  Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
       13  It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
       14  To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
       15  And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
       16  Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
    ROMEO
       17  Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
       18  I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
       19  I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
       20  'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
       21  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
       22  The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
       23  I have more care to stay than will to go:
       24  Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
       25  How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
    JULIET
       26  It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
       27  It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
       28  Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
       29  Some say the lark makes sweet division;
       30  This doth not so, for she divideth us:
       31  Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
       32  O, now I would they had changed voices too!
       33  Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
       34  Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
       35  O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
    ROMEO
       36  More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
  Direction: Enter Nurse, to the chamber
    Nurse
       37  Madam!
    JULIET
       38  Nurse?
    Nurse
       39  Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
       40  The day is broke; be wary, look about.
  Direction: Exit
    JULIET
       41  Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
    ROMEO
       42  Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
  Direction: He goeth down
    JULIET
       43  Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
       44  I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
       45  For in a minute there are many days:
       46  O, by this count I shall be much in years
       47  Ere I again behold my Romeo!
    ROMEO
       48  Farewell!
       49  I will omit no opportunity
       50  That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
    JULIET
       51  O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
    ROMEO
       52  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
       53  For sweet discourses in our time to come.
    JULIET
       54  O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
       55  Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
       56  As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
       57  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
    ROMEO
       58  And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
       59  Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
  Direction: Exit
    JULIET
       60  O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
       61  If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
       62  That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
       63  For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
       64  But send him back.
    LADY CAPULET
       65  [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
    JULIET
       66  Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
       67  Is she not down so late, or up so early?
       68  What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
  Direction: Enter LADY CAPULET
    LADY CAPULET
       69  Why, how now, Juliet!
    JULIET
       70  Madam, I am not well.
    LADY CAPULET
       71  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
       72  What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
       73  An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
       74  Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
       75  But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
    JULIET
       76  Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
    LADY CAPULET
       77  So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
       78  Which you weep for.
    JULIET
       79  Feeling so the loss,
       80  Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
    LADY CAPULET
       81  Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
       82  As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
    JULIET
       83  What villain madam?
    LADY CAPULET
       84  That same villain, Romeo.
    JULIET
       85  [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
       86  God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
       87  And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
    LADY CAPULET
       88  That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
    JULIET
       89  Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
       90  Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
    LADY CAPULET
       91  We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
       92  Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
       93  Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
       94  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
       95  That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
       96  And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
    JULIET
       97  Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
       98  With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
       99  Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
      100  Madam, if you could find out but a man
      101  To bear a poison, I would temper it;
      102  That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
      103  Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
      104  To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
      105  To wreak the love I bore my cousin
      106  Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
    LADY CAPULET
      107  Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
      108  But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
    JULIET
      109  And joy comes well in such a needy time:
      110  What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
    LADY CAPULET
      111  Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
      112  One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
      113  Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
      114  That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
    JULIET
      115  Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
    LADY CAPULET
      116  Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
      117  The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
      118  The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
      119  Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
    JULIET
      120  Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
      121  He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
      122  I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
      123  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
      124  I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
      125  I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
      126  It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
      127  Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
    LADY CAPULET
      128  Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
      129  And see how he will take it at your hands.
  Direction: Enter CAPULET and Nurse
    CAPULET
      130  When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
      131  But for the sunset of my brother's son
      132  It rains downright.
      133  How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
      134  Evermore showering? In one little body
      135  Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
      136  For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
      137  Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
      138  Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
      139  Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
      140  Without a sudden calm, will overset
      141  Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
      142  Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
    LADY CAPULET
      143  Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
      144  I would the fool were married to her grave!
    CAPULET
      145  Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
      146  How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
      147  Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
      148  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
      149  So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
    JULIET
      150  Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
      151  Proud can I never be of what I hate;
      152  But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
    CAPULET
      153  How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
      154  'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
      155  And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
      156  Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
      157  But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
      158  To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
      159  Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
      160  Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
      161  You tallow-face!
    LADY CAPULET
      162  Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
    JULIET
      163  Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
      164  Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
    CAPULET
      165  Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
      166  I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
      167  Or never after look me in the face:
      168  Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
      169  My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
      170  That God had lent us but this only child;
      171  But now I see this one is one too much,
      172  And that we have a curse in having her:
      173  Out on her, hilding!
    Nurse
      174  God in heaven bless her!
      175  You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
    CAPULET
      176  And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
      177  Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
    Nurse
      178  I speak no treason.
    CAPULET
      179  O, God ye god-den.
    Nurse
      180  May not one speak?
    CAPULET
      181  Peace, you mumbling fool!
      182  Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
      183  For here we need it not.
    LADY CAPULET
      184  You are too hot.
    CAPULET
      185  God's bread! it makes me mad:
      186  Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
      187  Alone, in company, still my care hath been
      188  To have her match'd: and having now provided
      189  A gentleman of noble parentage,
      190  Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
      191  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
      192  Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
      193  And then to have a wretched puling fool,
      194  A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
      195  To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
      196  I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
      197  But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
      198  Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
      199  Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
      200  Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
      201  An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
      202  And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
      203  the streets,
      204  For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
      205  Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
      206  Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
  Direction: Exit
    JULIET
      207  Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
      208  That sees into the bottom of my grief?
      209  O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
      210  Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
      211  Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
      212  In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
    LADY CAPULET
      213  Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
      214  Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
  Direction: Exit
    JULIET
      215  O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
      216  My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
      217  How shall that faith return again to earth,
      218  Unless that husband send it me from heaven
      219  By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
      220  Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
      221  Upon so soft a subject as myself!
      222  What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
      223  Some comfort, nurse.
    Nurse
      224  Faith, here it is.
      225  Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
      226  That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
      227  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
      228  Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
      229  I think it best you married with the county.
      230  O, he's a lovely gentleman!
      231  Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
      232  Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
      233  As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
      234  I think you are happy in this second match,
      235  For it excels your first: or if it did not,
      236  Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
      237  As living here and you no use of him.
    JULIET
      238  Speakest thou from thy heart?
    Nurse
      239  And from my soul too;
      240  Or else beshrew them both.
    JULIET
      241  Amen!
    Nurse
      242  What?
    JULIET
      243  Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
      244  Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
      245  Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
      246  To make confession and to be absolved.
    Nurse
      247  Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
  Direction: Exit
    JULIET
      248  Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
      249  Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
      250  Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
      251  Which she hath praised him with above compare
      252  So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
      253  Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
      254  I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
      255  If all else fail, myself have power to die.
  Direction: Exit
