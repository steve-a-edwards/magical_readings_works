For simplicity of the programming of 'Magical Readings', sections of plays labelled
'Prolog' or 'Induction' are given appropriate act or scene numbers.

For example:

Romeo and Juliet
----------------
Act 1, Prologue: PROLOGUE
becomes: Act 1, Scene 0

The Taming of the Shrew
-----------------------
Induction, Scene 1: Before an alehouse on a heath.
- becomes: Act 0, Scene 1

Induction, Scene 2: A bedchamber in the Lord's house.
- becomes: Act 0, Scene 2
