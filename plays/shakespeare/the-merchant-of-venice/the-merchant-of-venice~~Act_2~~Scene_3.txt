          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 2 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The same. A room in SHYLOCK'S house.
  Direction: Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT
    JESSICA
        1  I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
        2  Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
        3  Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
        4  But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:
        5  And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
        6  Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
        7  Give him this letter; do it secretly;
        8  And so farewell: I would not have my father
        9  See me in talk with thee.
    LAUNCELOT
       10  Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful
       11  pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play
       12  the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,
       13  adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
       14  manly spirit: adieu.
    JESSICA
       15  Farewell, good Launcelot.
  Direction: Exit Launcelot
       16  Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
       17  To be ashamed to be my father's child!
       18  But though I am a daughter to his blood,
       19  I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,
       20  If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
       21  Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
  Direction: Exit
