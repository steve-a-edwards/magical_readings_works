          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 2 : Scene 7

SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
  Direction: Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains
    PORTIA
        1  Go draw aside the curtains and discover
        2  The several caskets to this noble prince.
        3  Now make your choice.
    MOROCCO
        4  The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
        5  'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
        6  The second, silver, which this promise carries,
        7  'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
        8  This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
        9  'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
       10  How shall I know if I do choose the right?
    PORTIA
       11  The one of them contains my picture, prince:
       12  If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
    MOROCCO
       13  Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
       14  I will survey the inscriptions back again.
       15  What says this leaden casket?
       16  'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
       17  Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
       18  This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
       19  Do it in hope of fair advantages:
       20  A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
       21  I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
       22  What says the silver with her virgin hue?
       23  'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
       24  As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
       25  And weigh thy value with an even hand:
       26  If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
       27  Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
       28  May not extend so far as to the lady:
       29  And yet to be afeard of my deserving
       30  Were but a weak disabling of myself.
       31  As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
       32  I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
       33  In graces and in qualities of breeding;
       34  But more than these, in love I do deserve.
       35  What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
       36  Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
       37  'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
       38  Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
       39  From the four corners of the earth they come,
       40  To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
       41  The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
       42  Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
       43  For princes to come view fair Portia:
       44  The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
       45  Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
       46  To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
       47  As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
       48  One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
       49  Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
       50  To think so base a thought: it were too gross
       51  To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
       52  Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
       53  Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
       54  O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
       55  Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
       56  A coin that bears the figure of an angel
       57  Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
       58  But here an angel in a golden bed
       59  Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
       60  Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
    PORTIA
       61  There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
       62  Then I am yours.
  Direction: He unlocks the golden casket
    MOROCCO
       63  O hell! what have we here?
       64  A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
       65  There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
  Direction: Reads
       66  All that glitters is not gold;
       67  Often have you heard that told:
       68  Many a man his life hath sold
       69  But my outside to behold:
       70  Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
       71  Had you been as wise as bold,
       72  Young in limbs, in judgment old,
       73  Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
       74  Fare you well; your suit is cold.
       75  Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
       76  Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
       77  Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
       78  To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
  Direction: Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets
    PORTIA
       79  A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
       80  Let all of his complexion choose me so.
  Direction: Exeunt
