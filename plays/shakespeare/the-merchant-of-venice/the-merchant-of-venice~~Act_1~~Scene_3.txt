          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 1 : Scene 3

SCENE III. Venice. A public place.
  Direction: Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK
    SHYLOCK
        1  Three thousand ducats; well.
    BASSANIO
        2  Ay, sir, for three months.
    SHYLOCK
        3  For three months; well.
    BASSANIO
        4  For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
    SHYLOCK
        5  Antonio shall become bound; well.
    BASSANIO
        6  May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
        7  know your answer?
    SHYLOCK
        8  Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
    BASSANIO
        9  Your answer to that.
    SHYLOCK
       10  Antonio is a good man.
    BASSANIO
       11  Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
    SHYLOCK
       12  Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
       13  good man is to have you understand me that he is
       14  sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
       15  hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
       16  Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
       17  hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
       18  other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
       19  are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
       20  and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
       21  mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
       22  winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
       23  sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
       24  take his bond.
    BASSANIO
       25  Be assured you may.
    SHYLOCK
       26  I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
       27  I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
    BASSANIO
       28  If it please you to dine with us.
    SHYLOCK
       29  Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which
       30  your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
       31  will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
       32  walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
       33  with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
       34  news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
  Direction: Enter ANTONIO
    BASSANIO
       35  This is Signior Antonio.
    SHYLOCK
       36  [Aside] How like a fawning publican he looks!
       37  I hate him for he is a Christian,
       38  But more for that in low simplicity
       39  He lends out money gratis and brings down
       40  The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
       41  If I can catch him once upon the hip,
       42  I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
       43  He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
       44  Even there where merchants most do congregate,
       45  On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
       46  Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
       47  If I forgive him!
    BASSANIO
       48  Shylock, do you hear?
    SHYLOCK
       49  I am debating of my present store,
       50  And, by the near guess of my memory,
       51  I cannot instantly raise up the gross
       52  Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
       53  Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
       54  Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
       55  Do you desire?
  Direction: To ANTONIO
       56  Rest you fair, good signior;
       57  Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
    ANTONIO
       58  Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
       59  By taking nor by giving of excess,
       60  Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
       61  I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
       62  How much ye would?
    SHYLOCK
       63  Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
    ANTONIO
       64  And for three months.
    SHYLOCK
       65  I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
       66  Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
       67  Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
       68  Upon advantage.
    ANTONIO
       69  I do never use it.
    SHYLOCK
       70  When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
       71  This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
       72  As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
       73  The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
    ANTONIO
       74  And what of him? did he take interest?
    SHYLOCK
       75  No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
       76  Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
       77  When Laban and himself were compromised
       78  That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
       79  Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
       80  In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
       81  And, when the work of generation was
       82  Between these woolly breeders in the act,
       83  The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
       84  And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
       85  He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
       86  Who then conceiving did in eaning time
       87  Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
       88  This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
       89  And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
    ANTONIO
       90  This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
       91  A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
       92  But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
       93  Was this inserted to make interest good?
       94  Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
    SHYLOCK
       95  I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
       96  But note me, signior.
    ANTONIO
       97  Mark you this, Bassanio,
       98  The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
       99  An evil soul producing holy witness
      100  Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
      101  A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
      102  O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
    SHYLOCK
      103  Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
      104  Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--
    ANTONIO
      105  Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
    SHYLOCK
      106  Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
      107  In the Rialto you have rated me
      108  About my moneys and my usances:
      109  Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
      110  For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
      111  You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
      112  And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
      113  And all for use of that which is mine own.
      114  Well then, it now appears you need my help:
      115  Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
      116  'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
      117  You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
      118  And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
      119  Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
      120  What should I say to you? Should I not say
      121  'Hath a dog money? is it possible
      122  A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
      123  Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
      124  With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
      125  'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
      126  You spurn'd me such a day; another time
      127  You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
      128  I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
    ANTONIO
      129  I am as like to call thee so again,
      130  To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
      131  If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
      132  As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
      133  A breed for barren metal of his friend?
      134  But lend it rather to thine enemy,
      135  Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
      136  Exact the penalty.
    SHYLOCK
      137  Why, look you, how you storm!
      138  I would be friends with you and have your love,
      139  Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
      140  Supply your present wants and take no doit
      141  Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
      142  This is kind I offer.
    BASSANIO
      143  This were kindness.
    SHYLOCK
      144  This kindness will I show.
      145  Go with me to a notary, seal me there
      146  Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
      147  If you repay me not on such a day,
      148  In such a place, such sum or sums as are
      149  Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
      150  Be nominated for an equal pound
      151  Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
      152  In what part of your body pleaseth me.
    ANTONIO
      153  Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
      154  And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
    BASSANIO
      155  You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
      156  I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
    ANTONIO
      157  Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
      158  Within these two months, that's a month before
      159  This bond expires, I do expect return
      160  Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
    SHYLOCK
      161  O father Abram, what these Christians are,
      162  Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
      163  The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
      164  If he should break his day, what should I gain
      165  By the exaction of the forfeiture?
      166  A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
      167  Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
      168  As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
      169  To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
      170  If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
      171  And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
    ANTONIO
      172  Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
    SHYLOCK
      173  Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
      174  Give him direction for this merry bond,
      175  And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
      176  See to my house, left in the fearful guard
      177  Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
      178  I will be with you.
    ANTONIO
      179  Hie thee, gentle Jew.
  Direction: Exit Shylock
      180  The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.
    BASSANIO
      181  I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
    ANTONIO
      182  Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
      183  My ships come home a month before the day.
  Direction: Exeunt
