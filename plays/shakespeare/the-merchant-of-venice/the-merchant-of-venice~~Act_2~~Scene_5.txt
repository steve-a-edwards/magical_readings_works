          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 2 : Scene 5

SCENE V. The same. Before SHYLOCK'S house.
  Direction: Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT
    SHYLOCK
        1  Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
        2  The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
        3  What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
        4  As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
        5  And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
        6  Why, Jessica, I say!
    LAUNCELOT
        7  Why, Jessica!
    SHYLOCK
        8  Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
    LAUNCELOT
        9  Your worship was wont to tell me that
       10  I could do nothing without bidding.
  Direction: Enter Jessica
    JESSICA
       11  Call you? what is your will?
    SHYLOCK
       12  I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
       13  There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
       14  I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
       15  But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
       16  The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
       17  Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
       18  There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
       19  For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
    LAUNCELOT
       20  I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect
       21  your reproach.
    SHYLOCK
       22  So do I his.
    LAUNCELOT
       23  An they have conspired together, I will not say you
       24  shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not
       25  for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
       26  Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,
       27  falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
       28  year, in the afternoon.
    SHYLOCK
       29  What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
       30  Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
       31  And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
       32  Clamber not you up to the casements then,
       33  Nor thrust your head into the public street
       34  To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
       35  But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
       36  Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
       37  My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
       38  I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
       39  But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
       40  Say I will come.
    LAUNCELOT
       41  I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at
       42  window, for all this, There will come a Christian
       43  boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.
  Direction: Exit
    SHYLOCK
       44  What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
    JESSICA
       45  His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.
    SHYLOCK
       46  The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
       47  Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
       48  More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;
       49  Therefore I part with him, and part with him
       50  To one that would have him help to waste
       51  His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
       52  Perhaps I will return immediately:
       53  Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
       54  Fast bind, fast find;
       55  A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
  Direction: Exit
    JESSICA
       56  Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
       57  I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
  Direction: Exit
