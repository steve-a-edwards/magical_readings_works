          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 3 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
  Direction: Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and Attendants
    PORTIA
        1  I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
        2  Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
        3  I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
        4  There's something tells me, but it is not love,
        5  I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
        6  Hate counsels not in such a quality.
        7  But lest you should not understand me well,--
        8  And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
        9  I would detain you here some month or two
       10  Before you venture for me. I could teach you
       11  How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
       12  So will I never be: so may you miss me;
       13  But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
       14  That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
       15  They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
       16  One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
       17  Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
       18  And so all yours. O, these naughty times
       19  Put bars between the owners and their rights!
       20  And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
       21  Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
       22  I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
       23  To eke it and to draw it out in length,
       24  To stay you from election.
    BASSANIO
       25  Let me choose
       26  For as I am, I live upon the rack.
    PORTIA
       27  Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
       28  What treason there is mingled with your love.
    BASSANIO
       29  None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
       30  Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
       31  There may as well be amity and life
       32  'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
    PORTIA
       33  Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
       34  Where men enforced do speak anything.
    BASSANIO
       35  Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
    PORTIA
       36  Well then, confess and live.
    BASSANIO
       37  'Confess' and 'love'
       38  Had been the very sum of my confession:
       39  O happy torment, when my torturer
       40  Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
       41  But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
    PORTIA
       42  Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
       43  If you do love me, you will find me out.
       44  Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
       45  Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
       46  Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
       47  Fading in music: that the comparison
       48  May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
       49  And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
       50  And what is music then? Then music is
       51  Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
       52  To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
       53  As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
       54  That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
       55  And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
       56  With no less presence, but with much more love,
       57  Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
       58  The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
       59  To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
       60  The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
       61  With bleared visages, come forth to view
       62  The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
       63  Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
       64  I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
  Direction: Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself
       65  SONG.
       66  Tell me where is fancy bred,
       67  Or in the heart, or in the head?
       68  How begot, how nourished?
       69  Reply, reply.
       70  It is engender'd in the eyes,
       71  With gazing fed; and fancy dies
       72  In the cradle where it lies.
       73  Let us all ring fancy's knell
       74  I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.
    ALL
       75  Ding, dong, bell.
    BASSANIO
       76  So may the outward shows be least themselves:
       77  The world is still deceived with ornament.
       78  In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
       79  But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
       80  Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
       81  What damned error, but some sober brow
       82  Will bless it and approve it with a text,
       83  Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
       84  There is no vice so simple but assumes
       85  Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
       86  How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
       87  As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
       88  The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
       89  Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
       90  And these assume but valour's excrement
       91  To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
       92  And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
       93  Which therein works a miracle in nature,
       94  Making them lightest that wear most of it:
       95  So are those crisped snaky golden locks
       96  Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
       97  Upon supposed fairness, often known
       98  To be the dowry of a second head,
       99  The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
      100  Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
      101  To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
      102  Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
      103  The seeming truth which cunning times put on
      104  To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
      105  Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
      106  Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
      107  'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
      108  Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
      109  Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
      110  And here choose I; joy be the consequence!
    PORTIA
      111  [Aside] How all the other passions fleet to air,
      112  As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
      113  And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,
      114  Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
      115  In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
      116  I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
      117  For fear I surfeit.
    BASSANIO
      118  What find I here?
  Direction: Opening the leaden casket
      119  Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
      120  Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
      121  Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
      122  Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
      123  Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
      124  Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
      125  The painter plays the spider and hath woven
      126  A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
      127  Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
      128  How could he see to do them? having made one,
      129  Methinks it should have power to steal both his
      130  And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
      131  The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
      132  In underprizing it, so far this shadow
      133  Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
      134  The continent and summary of my fortune.
  Direction: Reads
      135  You that choose not by the view,
      136  Chance as fair and choose as true!
      137  Since this fortune falls to you,
      138  Be content and seek no new,
      139  If you be well pleased with this
      140  And hold your fortune for your bliss,
      141  Turn you where your lady is
      142  And claim her with a loving kiss.
      143  A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
      144  I come by note, to give and to receive.
      145  Like one of two contending in a prize,
      146  That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
      147  Hearing applause and universal shout,
      148  Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
      149  Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
      150  So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
      151  As doubtful whether what I see be true,
      152  Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
    PORTIA
      153  You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
      154  Such as I am: though for myself alone
      155  I would not be ambitious in my wish,
      156  To wish myself much better; yet, for you
      157  I would be trebled twenty times myself;
      158  A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
      159  That only to stand high in your account,
      160  I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
      161  Exceed account; but the full sum of me
      162  Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
      163  Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
      164  Happy in this, she is not yet so old
      165  But she may learn; happier than this,
      166  She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
      167  Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
      168  Commits itself to yours to be directed,
      169  As from her lord, her governor, her king.
      170  Myself and what is mine to you and yours
      171  Is now converted: but now I was the lord
      172  Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
      173  Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
      174  This house, these servants and this same myself
      175  Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
      176  Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
      177  Let it presage the ruin of your love
      178  And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
    BASSANIO
      179  Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
      180  Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
      181  And there is such confusion in my powers,
      182  As after some oration fairly spoke
      183  By a beloved prince, there doth appear
      184  Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
      185  Where every something, being blent together,
      186  Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
      187  Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
      188  Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
      189  O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!
    NERISSA
      190  My lord and lady, it is now our time,
      191  That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
      192  To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!
    GRATIANO
      193  My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
      194  I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
      195  For I am sure you can wish none from me:
      196  And when your honours mean to solemnize
      197  The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
      198  Even at that time I may be married too.
    BASSANIO
      199  With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
    GRATIANO
      200  I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
      201  My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
      202  You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
      203  You loved, I loved for intermission.
      204  No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
      205  Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
      206  And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
      207  For wooing here until I sweat again,
      208  And sweating until my very roof was dry
      209  With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
      210  I got a promise of this fair one here
      211  To have her love, provided that your fortune
      212  Achieved her mistress.
    PORTIA
      213  Is this true, Nerissa?
    NERISSA
      214  Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
    BASSANIO
      215  And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
    GRATIANO
      216  Yes, faith, my lord.
    BASSANIO
      217  Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
    GRATIANO
      218  We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
    NERISSA
      219  What, and stake down?
    GRATIANO
      220  No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
      221  But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
      222  and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
  Direction: Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger from Venice
    BASSANIO
      223  Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
      224  If that the youth of my new interest here
      225  Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
      226  I bid my very friends and countrymen,
      227  Sweet Portia, welcome.
    PORTIA
      228  So do I, my lord:
      229  They are entirely welcome.
    LORENZO
      230  I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
      231  My purpose was not to have seen you here;
      232  But meeting with Salerio by the way,
      233  He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
      234  To come with him along.
    SALERIO
      235  I did, my lord;
      236  And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
      237  Commends him to you.
  Direction: Gives Bassanio a letter
    BASSANIO
      238  Ere I ope his letter,
      239  I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
    SALERIO
      240  Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
      241  Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
      242  Will show you his estate.
    GRATIANO
      243  Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
      244  Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
      245  How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
      246  I know he will be glad of our success;
      247  We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
    SALERIO
      248  I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
    PORTIA
      249  There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
      250  That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
      251  Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
      252  Could turn so much the constitution
      253  Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
      254  With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
      255  And I must freely have the half of anything
      256  That this same paper brings you.
    BASSANIO
      257  O sweet Portia,
      258  Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
      259  That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
      260  When I did first impart my love to you,
      261  I freely told you, all the wealth I had
      262  Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
      263  And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
      264  Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
      265  How much I was a braggart. When I told you
      266  My state was nothing, I should then have told you
      267  That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
      268  I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
      269  Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
      270  To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
      271  The paper as the body of my friend,
      272  And every word in it a gaping wound,
      273  Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
      274  Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
      275  From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
      276  From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
      277  And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
      278  Of merchant-marring rocks?
    SALERIO
      279  Not one, my lord.
      280  Besides, it should appear, that if he had
      281  The present money to discharge the Jew,
      282  He would not take it. Never did I know
      283  A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
      284  So keen and greedy to confound a man:
      285  He plies the duke at morning and at night,
      286  And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
      287  If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
      288  The duke himself, and the magnificoes
      289  Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
      290  But none can drive him from the envious plea
      291  Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
    JESSICA
      292  When I was with him I have heard him swear
      293  To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
      294  That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
      295  Than twenty times the value of the sum
      296  That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
      297  If law, authority and power deny not,
      298  It will go hard with poor Antonio.
    PORTIA
      299  Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
    BASSANIO
      300  The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
      301  The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
      302  In doing courtesies, and one in whom
      303  The ancient Roman honour more appears
      304  Than any that draws breath in Italy.
    PORTIA
      305  What sum owes he the Jew?
    BASSANIO
      306  For me three thousand ducats.
    PORTIA
      307  What, no more?
      308  Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
      309  Double six thousand, and then treble that,
      310  Before a friend of this description
      311  Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
      312  First go with me to church and call me wife,
      313  And then away to Venice to your friend;
      314  For never shall you lie by Portia's side
      315  With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
      316  To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
      317  When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
      318  My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
      319  Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
      320  For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
      321  Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
      322  Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
      323  But let me hear the letter of your friend.
    BASSANIO
      324  [Reads] Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
      325  miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
      326  very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since
      327  in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
      328  debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
      329  see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
      330  pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
      331  let not my letter.
    PORTIA
      332  O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!
    BASSANIO
      333  Since I have your good leave to go away,
      334  I will make haste: but, till I come again,
      335  No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
      336  No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
  Direction: Exeunt
