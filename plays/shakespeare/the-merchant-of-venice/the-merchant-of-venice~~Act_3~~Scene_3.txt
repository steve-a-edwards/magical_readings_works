          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 3 : Scene 3

SCENE III. Venice. A street.
  Direction: Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler
    SHYLOCK
        1  Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
        2  This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
        3  Gaoler, look to him.
    ANTONIO
        4  Hear me yet, good Shylock.
    SHYLOCK
        5  I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
        6  I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
        7  Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
        8  But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
        9  The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
       10  Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
       11  To come abroad with him at his request.
    ANTONIO
       12  I pray thee, hear me speak.
    SHYLOCK
       13  I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
       14  I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
       15  I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
       16  To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
       17  To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
       18  I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
  Direction: Exit
    SALARINO
       19  It is the most impenetrable cur
       20  That ever kept with men.
    ANTONIO
       21  Let him alone:
       22  I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
       23  He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
       24  I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
       25  Many that have at times made moan to me;
       26  Therefore he hates me.
    SALARINO
       27  I am sure the duke
       28  Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
    ANTONIO
       29  The duke cannot deny the course of law:
       30  For the commodity that strangers have
       31  With us in Venice, if it be denied,
       32  Will much impeach the justice of his state;
       33  Since that the trade and profit of the city
       34  Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
       35  These griefs and losses have so bated me,
       36  That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
       37  To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
       38  Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
       39  To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!
  Direction: Exeunt
