          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Venice. A street.
  Direction: Enter LAUNCELOT
    LAUNCELOT
        1  Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
        2  this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
        3  tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good
        4  Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot
        5  Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My
        6  conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;
        7  take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest
        8  Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
        9  heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
       10  pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
       11  fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
       12  says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
       13  hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
       14  to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
       15  man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,
       16  indeed, my father did something smack, something
       17  grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience
       18  says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the
       19  fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
       20  'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'
       21  say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
       22  conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
       23  who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to
       24  run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
       25  fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
       26  himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
       27  incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
       28  but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
       29  me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
       30  friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are
       31  at your command; I will run.
  Direction: Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket
    GOBBO
       32  Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way
       33  to master Jew's?
    LAUNCELOT
       34  [Aside] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!
       35  who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,
       36  knows me not: I will try confusions with him.
    GOBBO
       37  Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way
       38  to master Jew's?
    LAUNCELOT
       39  Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
       40  at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at
       41  the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
       42  down indirectly to the Jew's house.
    GOBBO
       43  By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can
       44  you tell me whether one Launcelot,
       45  that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?
    LAUNCELOT
       46  Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
  Direction: Aside
       47  Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you
       48  of young Master Launcelot?
    GOBBO
       49  No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,
       50  though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man
       51  and, God be thanked, well to live.
    LAUNCELOT
       52  Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of
       53  young Master Launcelot.
    GOBBO
       54  Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.
    LAUNCELOT
       55  But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
       56  talk you of young Master Launcelot?
    GOBBO
       57  Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
    LAUNCELOT
       58  Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master
       59  Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,
       60  according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
       61  sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
       62  learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say
       63  in plain terms, gone to heaven.
    GOBBO
       64  Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my
       65  age, my very prop.
    LAUNCELOT
       66  Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
       67  a prop? Do you know me, father?
    GOBBO
       68  Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:
       69  but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his
       70  soul, alive or dead?
    LAUNCELOT
       71  Do you not know me, father?
    GOBBO
       72  Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
    LAUNCELOT
       73  Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
       74  the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
       75  own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
       76  your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
       77  to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
       78  may, but at the length truth will out.
    GOBBO
       79  Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not
       80  Launcelot, my boy.
    LAUNCELOT
       81  Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but
       82  give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy
       83  that was, your son that is, your child that shall
       84  be.
    GOBBO
       85  I cannot think you are my son.
    LAUNCELOT
       86  I know not what I shall think of that: but I am
       87  Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your
       88  wife is my mother.
    GOBBO
       89  Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou
       90  be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
       91  Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
       92  got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
       93  Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
    LAUNCELOT
       94  It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
       95  backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail
       96  than I have of my face when I last saw him.
    GOBBO
       97  Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy
       98  master agree? I have brought him a present. How
       99  'gree you now?
    LAUNCELOT
      100  Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set
      101  up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I
      102  have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give
      103  him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
      104  his service; you may tell every finger I have with
      105  my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me
      106  your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,
      107  gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I
      108  will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
      109  fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I
      110  am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
  Direction: Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers
    BASSANIO
      111  You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper
      112  be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
      113  these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,
      114  and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
  Direction: Exit a Servant
    LAUNCELOT
      115  To him, father.
    GOBBO
      116  God bless your worship!
    BASSANIO
      117  Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?
    GOBBO
      118  Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--
    LAUNCELOT
      119  Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that
      120  would, sir, as my father shall specify--
    GOBBO
      121  He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--
    LAUNCELOT
      122  Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
      123  and have a desire, as my father shall specify--
    GOBBO
      124  His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,
      125  are scarce cater-cousins--
    LAUNCELOT
      126  To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having
      127  done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I
      128  hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--
    GOBBO
      129  I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
      130  your worship, and my suit is--
    LAUNCELOT
      131  In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
      132  your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,
      133  though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.
    BASSANIO
      134  One speak for both. What would you?
    LAUNCELOT
      135  Serve you, sir.
    GOBBO
      136  That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
    BASSANIO
      137  I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
      138  Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
      139  And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
      140  To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
      141  The follower of so poor a gentleman.
    LAUNCELOT
      142  The old proverb is very well parted between my
      143  master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of
      144  God, sir, and he hath enough.
    BASSANIO
      145  Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
      146  Take leave of thy old master and inquire
      147  My lodging out. Give him a livery
      148  More guarded than his fellows': see it done.
    LAUNCELOT
      149  Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have
      150  ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in
      151  Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
      152  upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,
      153  here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle
      154  of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven
      155  widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
      156  man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be
      157  in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;
      158  here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a
      159  woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
      160  come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
  Direction: Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo
    BASSANIO
      161  I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
      162  These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,
      163  Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
      164  My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.
    LEONARDO
      165  My best endeavours shall be done herein.
  Direction: Enter GRATIANO
    GRATIANO
      166  Where is your master?
    LEONARDO
      167  Yonder, sir, he walks.
  Direction: Exit
    GRATIANO
      168  Signior Bassanio!
    BASSANIO
      169  Gratiano!
    GRATIANO
      170  I have a suit to you.
    BASSANIO
      171  You have obtain'd it.
    GRATIANO
      172  You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
    BASSANIO
      173  Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;
      174  Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
      175  Parts that become thee happily enough
      176  And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
      177  But where thou art not known, why, there they show
      178  Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
      179  To allay with some cold drops of modesty
      180  Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
      181  I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
      182  And lose my hopes.
    GRATIANO
      183  Signior Bassanio, hear me:
      184  If I do not put on a sober habit,
      185  Talk with respect and swear but now and then,
      186  Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
      187  Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
      188  Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
      189  Use all the observance of civility,
      190  Like one well studied in a sad ostent
      191  To please his grandam, never trust me more.
    BASSANIO
      192  Well, we shall see your bearing.
    GRATIANO
      193  Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
      194  By what we do to-night.
    BASSANIO
      195  No, that were pity:
      196  I would entreat you rather to put on
      197  Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
      198  That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
      199  I have some business.
    GRATIANO
      200  And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
      201  But we will visit you at supper-time.
  Direction: Exeunt
