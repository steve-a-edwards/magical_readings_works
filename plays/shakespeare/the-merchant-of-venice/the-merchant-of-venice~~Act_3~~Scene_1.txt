          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Venice. A street.
  Direction: Enter SALANIO and SALARINO
    SALANIO
        1  Now, what news on the Rialto?
    SALARINO
        2  Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath
        3  a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;
        4  the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very
        5  dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many
        6  a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
        7  Report be an honest woman of her word.
    SALANIO
        8  I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
        9  knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
       10  wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
       11  true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
       12  plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
       13  honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
       14  to keep his name company!--
    SALARINO
       15  Come, the full stop.
    SALANIO
       16  Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
       17  lost a ship.
    SALARINO
       18  I would it might prove the end of his losses.
    SALANIO
       19  Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my
       20  prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
  Direction: Enter SHYLOCK
       21  How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?
    SHYLOCK
       22  You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my
       23  daughter's flight.
    SALARINO
       24  That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
       25  that made the wings she flew withal.
    SALANIO
       26  And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
       27  fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
       28  to leave the dam.
    SHYLOCK
       29  She is damned for it.
    SALANIO
       30  That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
    SHYLOCK
       31  My own flesh and blood to rebel!
    SALANIO
       32  Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?
    SHYLOCK
       33  I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.
    SALARINO
       34  There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
       35  than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
       36  than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
       37  tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
       38  loss at sea or no?
    SHYLOCK
       39  There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
       40  prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
       41  Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
       42  the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
       43  call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
       44  wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
       45  look to his bond.
    SALARINO
       46  Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take
       47  his flesh: what's that good for?
    SHYLOCK
       48  To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,
       49  it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
       50  hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,
       51  mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
       52  bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
       53  enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
       54  not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
       55  dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
       56  the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
       57  to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
       58  warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
       59  a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
       60  if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
       61  us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
       62  revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
       63  resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
       64  what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
       65  wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
       66  Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
       67  teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
       68  will better the instruction.
  Direction: Enter a Servant
    Servant
       69  Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and
       70  desires to speak with you both.
    SALARINO
       71  We have been up and down to seek him.
  Direction: Enter TUBAL
    SALANIO
       72  Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
       73  matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
  Direction: Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant
    SHYLOCK
       74  How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou
       75  found my daughter?
    TUBAL
       76  I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
    SHYLOCK
       77  Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,
       78  cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
       79  never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
       80  till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
       81  precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
       82  were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!
       83  would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in
       84  her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know
       85  not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon
       86  loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to
       87  find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
       88  nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
       89  shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
       90  but of my shedding.
    TUBAL
       91  Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I
       92  heard in Genoa,--
    SHYLOCK
       93  What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?
    TUBAL
       94  Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.
    SHYLOCK
       95  I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?
    TUBAL
       96  I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
    SHYLOCK
       97  I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!
       98  ha, ha! where? in Genoa?
    TUBAL
       99  Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one
      100  night fourscore ducats.
    SHYLOCK
      101  Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
      102  gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
      103  fourscore ducats!
    TUBAL
      104  There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
      105  company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.
    SHYLOCK
      106  I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture
      107  him: I am glad of it.
    TUBAL
      108  One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
      109  daughter for a monkey.
    SHYLOCK
      110  Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
      111  turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
      112  I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
    TUBAL
      113  But Antonio is certainly undone.
    SHYLOCK
      114  Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee
      115  me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I
      116  will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were
      117  he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I
      118  will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
      119  go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.
  Direction: Exeunt
