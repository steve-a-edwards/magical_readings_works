          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 2 : Scene 8

SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.
  Direction: Enter SALARINO and SALANIO
    SALARINO
        1  Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
        2  With him is Gratiano gone along;
        3  And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
    SALANIO
        4  The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
        5  Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
    SALARINO
        6  He came too late, the ship was under sail:
        7  But there the duke was given to understand
        8  That in a gondola were seen together
        9  Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
       10  Besides, Antonio certified the duke
       11  They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
    SALANIO
       12  I never heard a passion so confused,
       13  So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
       14  As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
       15  'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
       16  Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
       17  Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
       18  A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
       19  Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
       20  And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
       21  Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
       22  She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'
    SALARINO
       23  Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
       24  Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
    SALANIO
       25  Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
       26  Or he shall pay for this.
    SALARINO
       27  Marry, well remember'd.
       28  I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
       29  Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
       30  The French and English, there miscarried
       31  A vessel of our country richly fraught:
       32  I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
       33  And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
    SALANIO
       34  You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
       35  Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
    SALARINO
       36  A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
       37  I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
       38  Bassanio told him he would make some speed
       39  Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
       40  Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
       41  But stay the very riping of the time;
       42  And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
       43  Let it not enter in your mind of love:
       44  Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
       45  To courtship and such fair ostents of love
       46  As shall conveniently become you there:'
       47  And even there, his eye being big with tears,
       48  Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
       49  And with affection wondrous sensible
       50  He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
    SALANIO
       51  I think he only loves the world for him.
       52  I pray thee, let us go and find him out
       53  And quicken his embraced heaviness
       54  With some delight or other.
    SALARINO
       55  Do we so.
  Direction: Exeunt
