          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 2 : Scene 9

SCENE IX. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
  Direction: Enter NERISSA with a Servitor
    NERISSA
        1  Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
        2  The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
        3  And comes to his election presently.
  Direction: Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their trains
    PORTIA
        4  Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
        5  If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
        6  Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
        7  But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
        8  You must be gone from hence immediately.
    ARRAGON
        9  I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
       10  First, never to unfold to any one
       11  Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
       12  Of the right casket, never in my life
       13  To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
       14  If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
       15  Immediately to leave you and be gone.
    PORTIA
       16  To these injunctions every one doth swear
       17  That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
    ARRAGON
       18  And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
       19  To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
       20  'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
       21  You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
       22  What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
       23  'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
       24  What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
       25  By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
       26  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
       27  Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
       28  Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
       29  Even in the force and road of casualty.
       30  I will not choose what many men desire,
       31  Because I will not jump with common spirits
       32  And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
       33  Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
       34  Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
       35  'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
       36  And well said too; for who shall go about
       37  To cozen fortune and be honourable
       38  Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
       39  To wear an undeserved dignity.
       40  O, that estates, degrees and offices
       41  Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
       42  Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
       43  How many then should cover that stand bare!
       44  How many be commanded that command!
       45  How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
       46  From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
       47  Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
       48  To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
       49  'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
       50  I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
       51  And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
  Direction: He opens the silver casket
    PORTIA
       52  Too long a pause for that which you find there.
    ARRAGON
       53  What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
       54  Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
       55  How much unlike art thou to Portia!
       56  How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
       57  'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
       58  Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
       59  Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
    PORTIA
       60  To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
       61  And of opposed natures.
    ARRAGON
       62  What is here?
  Direction: Reads
       63  The fire seven times tried this:
       64  Seven times tried that judgment is,
       65  That did never choose amiss.
       66  Some there be that shadows kiss;
       67  Such have but a shadow's bliss:
       68  There be fools alive, I wis,
       69  Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
       70  Take what wife you will to bed,
       71  I will ever be your head:
       72  So be gone: you are sped.
       73  Still more fool I shall appear
       74  By the time I linger here
       75  With one fool's head I came to woo,
       76  But I go away with two.
       77  Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
       78  Patiently to bear my wroth.
  Direction: Exeunt Arragon and train
    PORTIA
       79  Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
       80  O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
       81  They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
    NERISSA
       82  The ancient saying is no heresy,
       83  Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
    PORTIA
       84  Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
  Direction: Enter a Servant
    Servant
       85  Where is my lady?
    PORTIA
       86  Here: what would my lord?
    Servant
       87  Madam, there is alighted at your gate
       88  A young Venetian, one that comes before
       89  To signify the approaching of his lord;
       90  From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
       91  To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
       92  Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
       93  So likely an ambassador of love:
       94  A day in April never came so sweet,
       95  To show how costly summer was at hand,
       96  As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
    PORTIA
       97  No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
       98  Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
       99  Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
      100  Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
      101  Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.
    NERISSA
      102  Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!
  Direction: Exeunt
