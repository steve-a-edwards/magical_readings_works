          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 3 : Scene 5

SCENE V. The same. A garden.
  Direction: Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA
    LAUNCELOT
        1  Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father
        2  are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I
        3  promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
        4  you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
        5  therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
        6  are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
        7  you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
        8  hope neither.
    JESSICA
        9  And what hope is that, I pray thee?
    LAUNCELOT
       10  Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
       11  not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
    JESSICA
       12  That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
       13  sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
    LAUNCELOT
       14  Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
       15  mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
       16  fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
       17  gone both ways.
    JESSICA
       18  I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
       19  Christian.
    LAUNCELOT
       20  Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
       21  enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
       22  another. This making Christians will raise the
       23  price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
       24  shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
  Direction: Enter LORENZO
    JESSICA
       25  I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.
    LORENZO
       26  I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if
       27  you thus get my wife into corners.
    JESSICA
       28  Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
       29  are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
       30  me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
       31  says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
       32  for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
       33  price of pork.
    LORENZO
       34  I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
       35  you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
       36  Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.
    LAUNCELOT
       37  It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
       38  but if she be less than an honest woman, she is
       39  indeed more than I took her for.
    LORENZO
       40  How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
       41  best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,
       42  and discourse grow commendable in none only but
       43  parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.
    LAUNCELOT
       44  That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
    LORENZO
       45  Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid
       46  them prepare dinner.
    LAUNCELOT
       47  That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.
    LORENZO
       48  Will you cover then, sir?
    LAUNCELOT
       49  Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
    LORENZO
       50  Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
       51  the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
       52  tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:
       53  go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve
       54  in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
    LAUNCELOT
       55  For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the
       56  meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in
       57  to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
       58  conceits shall govern.
  Direction: Exit
    LORENZO
       59  O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
       60  The fool hath planted in his memory
       61  An army of good words; and I do know
       62  A many fools, that stand in better place,
       63  Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
       64  Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?
       65  And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
       66  How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?
    JESSICA
       67  Past all expressing. It is very meet
       68  The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
       69  For, having such a blessing in his lady,
       70  He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
       71  And if on earth he do not mean it, then
       72  In reason he should never come to heaven
       73  Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
       74  And on the wager lay two earthly women,
       75  And Portia one, there must be something else
       76  Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
       77  Hath not her fellow.
    LORENZO
       78  Even such a husband
       79  Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
    JESSICA
       80  Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
    LORENZO
       81  I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.
    JESSICA
       82  Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
    LORENZO
       83  No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
       84  ' Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things
       85  I shall digest it.
    JESSICA
       86  Well, I'll set you forth.
  Direction: Exeunt
