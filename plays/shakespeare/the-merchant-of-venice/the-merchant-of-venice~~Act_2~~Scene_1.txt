          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
  Direction: Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO and his train; PORTIA, NERISSA, and others attending
    MOROCCO
        1  Mislike me not for my complexion,
        2  The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,
        3  To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
        4  Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
        5  Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
        6  And let us make incision for your love,
        7  To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
        8  I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
        9  Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
       10  The best-regarded virgins of our clime
       11  Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
       12  Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
    PORTIA
       13  In terms of choice I am not solely led
       14  By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
       15  Besides, the lottery of my destiny
       16  Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
       17  But if my father had not scanted me
       18  And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
       19  His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
       20  Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
       21  As any comer I have look'd on yet
       22  For my affection.
    MOROCCO
       23  Even for that I thank you:
       24  Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
       25  To try my fortune. By this scimitar
       26  That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
       27  That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
       28  I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
       29  Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
       30  Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
       31  Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
       32  To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
       33  If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
       34  Which is the better man, the greater throw
       35  May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
       36  So is Alcides beaten by his page;
       37  And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
       38  Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
       39  And die with grieving.
    PORTIA
       40  You must take your chance,
       41  And either not attempt to choose at all
       42  Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
       43  Never to speak to lady afterward
       44  In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
    MOROCCO
       45  Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
    PORTIA
       46  First, forward to the temple: after dinner
       47  Your hazard shall be made.
    MOROCCO
       48  Good fortune then!
       49  To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
  Direction: Cornets, and exeunt
