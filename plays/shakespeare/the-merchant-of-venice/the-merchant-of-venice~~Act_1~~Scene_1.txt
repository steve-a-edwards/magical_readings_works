          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Venice. A street.
  Direction: Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO
    ANTONIO
        1  In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
        2  It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
        3  But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
        4  What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
        5  I am to learn;
        6  And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
        7  That I have much ado to know myself.
    SALARINO
        8  Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
        9  There, where your argosies with portly sail,
       10  Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
       11  Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
       12  Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
       13  That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
       14  As they fly by them with their woven wings.
    SALANIO
       15  Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
       16  The better part of my affections would
       17  Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
       18  Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
       19  Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
       20  And every object that might make me fear
       21  Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
       22  Would make me sad.
    SALARINO
       23  My wind cooling my broth
       24  Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
       25  What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
       26  I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
       27  But I should think of shallows and of flats,
       28  And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
       29  Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
       30  To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
       31  And see the holy edifice of stone,
       32  And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
       33  Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
       34  Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
       35  Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
       36  And, in a word, but even now worth this,
       37  And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
       38  To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
       39  That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
       40  But tell not me; I know, Antonio
       41  Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
    ANTONIO
       42  Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
       43  My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
       44  Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
       45  Upon the fortune of this present year:
       46  Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
    SALARINO
       47  Why, then you are in love.
    ANTONIO
       48  Fie, fie!
    SALARINO
       49  Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
       50  Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
       51  For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
       52  Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
       53  Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
       54  Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
       55  And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
       56  And other of such vinegar aspect
       57  That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
       58  Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
  Direction: Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO
    SALANIO
       59  Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
       60  Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
       61  We leave you now with better company.
    SALARINO
       62  I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
       63  If worthier friends had not prevented me.
    ANTONIO
       64  Your worth is very dear in my regard.
       65  I take it, your own business calls on you
       66  And you embrace the occasion to depart.
    SALARINO
       67  Good morrow, my good lords.
    BASSANIO
       68  Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
       69  You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
    SALARINO
       70  We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
  Direction: Exeunt Salarino and Salanio
    LORENZO
       71  My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
       72  We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
       73  I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
    BASSANIO
       74  I will not fail you.
    GRATIANO
       75  You look not well, Signior Antonio;
       76  You have too much respect upon the world:
       77  They lose it that do buy it with much care:
       78  Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
    ANTONIO
       79  I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
       80  A stage where every man must play a part,
       81  And mine a sad one.
    GRATIANO
       82  Let me play the fool:
       83  With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
       84  And let my liver rather heat with wine
       85  Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
       86  Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
       87  Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
       88  Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
       89  By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
       90  I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
       91  There are a sort of men whose visages
       92  Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
       93  And do a wilful stillness entertain,
       94  With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
       95  Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
       96  As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
       97  And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
       98  O my Antonio, I do know of these
       99  That therefore only are reputed wise
      100  For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
      101  If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
      102  Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
      103  I'll tell thee more of this another time:
      104  But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
      105  For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
      106  Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
      107  I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
    LORENZO
      108  Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
      109  I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
      110  For Gratiano never lets me speak.
    GRATIANO
      111  Well, keep me company but two years moe,
      112  Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
    ANTONIO
      113  Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
    GRATIANO
      114  Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
      115  In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
  Direction: Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO
    ANTONIO
      116  Is that any thing now?
    BASSANIO
      117  Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
      118  than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
      119  grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
      120  shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
      121  have them, they are not worth the search.
    ANTONIO
      122  Well, tell me now what lady is the same
      123  To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
      124  That you to-day promised to tell me of?
    BASSANIO
      125  'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
      126  How much I have disabled mine estate,
      127  By something showing a more swelling port
      128  Than my faint means would grant continuance:
      129  Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
      130  From such a noble rate; but my chief care
      131  Is to come fairly off from the great debts
      132  Wherein my time something too prodigal
      133  Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
      134  I owe the most, in money and in love,
      135  And from your love I have a warranty
      136  To unburden all my plots and purposes
      137  How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
    ANTONIO
      138  I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
      139  And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
      140  Within the eye of honour, be assured,
      141  My purse, my person, my extremest means,
      142  Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
    BASSANIO
      143  In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
      144  I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
      145  The self-same way with more advised watch,
      146  To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
      147  I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
      148  Because what follows is pure innocence.
      149  I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
      150  That which I owe is lost; but if you please
      151  To shoot another arrow that self way
      152  Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
      153  As I will watch the aim, or to find both
      154  Or bring your latter hazard back again
      155  And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
    ANTONIO
      156  You know me well, and herein spend but time
      157  To wind about my love with circumstance;
      158  And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
      159  In making question of my uttermost
      160  Than if you had made waste of all I have:
      161  Then do but say to me what I should do
      162  That in your knowledge may by me be done,
      163  And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.
    BASSANIO
      164  In Belmont is a lady richly left;
      165  And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
      166  Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
      167  I did receive fair speechless messages:
      168  Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
      169  To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
      170  Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
      171  For the four winds blow in from every coast
      172  Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
      173  Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
      174  Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
      175  And many Jasons come in quest of her.
      176  O my Antonio, had I but the means
      177  To hold a rival place with one of them,
      178  I have a mind presages me such thrift,
      179  That I should questionless be fortunate!
    ANTONIO
      180  Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
      181  Neither have I money nor commodity
      182  To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
      183  Try what my credit can in Venice do:
      184  That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
      185  To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
      186  Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
      187  Where money is, and I no question make
      188  To have it of my trust or for my sake.
