          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
  Direction: Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
    PORTIA
        1  By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
        2  this great world.
    NERISSA
        3  You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
        4  the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
        5  yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
        6  with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
        7  is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
        8  mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
        9  competency lives longer.
    PORTIA
       10  Good sentences and well pronounced.
    NERISSA
       11  They would be better, if well followed.
    PORTIA
       12  If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
       13  do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
       14  cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
       15  follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
       16  twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
       17  twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
       18  devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
       19  o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
       20  youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
       21  cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
       22  choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
       23  neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
       24  dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
       25  by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
       26  Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?
    NERISSA
       27  Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
       28  death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
       29  that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
       30  silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
       31  chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
       32  rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
       33  warmth is there in your affection towards any of
       34  these princely suitors that are already come?
    PORTIA
       35  I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
       36  them, I will describe them; and, according to my
       37  description, level at my affection.
    NERISSA
       38  First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
    PORTIA
       39  Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
       40  talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
       41  appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
       42  shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
       43  mother played false with a smith.
    NERISSA
       44  Then there is the County Palatine.
    PORTIA
       45  He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
       46  will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
       47  smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
       48  philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
       49  unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
       50  married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
       51  than to either of these. God defend me from these
       52  two!
    NERISSA
       53  How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
    PORTIA
       54  God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
       55  In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
       56  he! why, he hath a horse better than the
       57  Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
       58  the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
       59  throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
       60  fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
       61  should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
       62  I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
       63  shall never requite him.
    NERISSA
       64  What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
       65  of England?
    PORTIA
       66  You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
       67  not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
       68  nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
       69  swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
       70  He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
       71  converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
       72  I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
       73  hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
       74  behavior every where.
    NERISSA
       75  What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
    PORTIA
       76  That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
       77  borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
       78  swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
       79  think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
       80  under for another.
    NERISSA
       81  How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
    PORTIA
       82  Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
       83  most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
       84  he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
       85  when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
       86  and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
       87  make shift to go without him.
    NERISSA
       88  If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
       89  casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
       90  will, if you should refuse to accept him.
    PORTIA
       91  Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
       92  deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
       93  for if the devil be within and that temptation
       94  without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
       95  thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.
    NERISSA
       96  You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
       97  lords: they have acquainted me with their
       98  determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
       99  home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
      100  you may be won by some other sort than your father's
      101  imposition depending on the caskets.
    PORTIA
      102  If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
      103  chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
      104  of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
      105  are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
      106  but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
      107  them a fair departure.
    NERISSA
      108  Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
      109  Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
      110  in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
    PORTIA
      111  Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.
    NERISSA
      112  True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
      113  eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
    PORTIA
      114  I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
      115  thy praise.
  Direction: Enter a Serving-man
      116  How now! what news?
    Servant
      117  The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
      118  their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
      119  fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
      120  prince his master will be here to-night.
    PORTIA
      121  If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
      122  heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
      123  be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
      124  of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
      125  rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
      126  Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
      127  Whiles we shut the gates
      128  upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.
  Direction: Exeunt
