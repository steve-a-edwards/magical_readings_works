          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 2 : Scene 6

SCENE VI. The same.
  Direction: Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued
    GRATIANO
        1  This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
        2  Desired us to make stand.
    SALARINO
        3  His hour is almost past.
    GRATIANO
        4  And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
        5  For lovers ever run before the clock.
    SALARINO
        6  O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
        7  To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
        8  To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
    GRATIANO
        9  That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
       10  With that keen appetite that he sits down?
       11  Where is the horse that doth untread again
       12  His tedious measures with the unbated fire
       13  That he did pace them first? All things that are,
       14  Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
       15  How like a younker or a prodigal
       16  The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
       17  Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
       18  How like the prodigal doth she return,
       19  With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
       20  Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
    SALARINO
       21  Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
  Direction: Enter LORENZO
    LORENZO
       22  Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
       23  Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
       24  When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
       25  I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
       26  Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
  Direction: Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes
    JESSICA
       27  Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
       28  Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
    LORENZO
       29  Lorenzo, and thy love.
    JESSICA
       30  Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
       31  For who love I so much? And now who knows
       32  But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
    LORENZO
       33  Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
    JESSICA
       34  Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
       35  I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
       36  For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
       37  But love is blind and lovers cannot see
       38  The pretty follies that themselves commit;
       39  For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
       40  To see me thus transformed to a boy.
    LORENZO
       41  Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
    JESSICA
       42  What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
       43  They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
       44  Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
       45  And I should be obscured.
    LORENZO
       46  So are you, sweet,
       47  Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
       48  But come at once;
       49  For the close night doth play the runaway,
       50  And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
    JESSICA
       51  I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
       52  With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
  Direction: Exit above
    GRATIANO
       53  Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.
    LORENZO
       54  Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
       55  For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
       56  And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
       57  And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
       58  And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
       59  Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
  Direction: Enter JESSICA, below
       60  What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!
       61  Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
  Direction: Exit with Jessica and Salarino
  Direction: Enter ANTONIO
    ANTONIO
       62  Who's there?
    GRATIANO
       63  Signior Antonio!
    ANTONIO
       64  Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
       65  'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
       66  No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
       67  Bassanio presently will go aboard:
       68  I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
    GRATIANO
       69  I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
       70  Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
  Direction: Exeunt
