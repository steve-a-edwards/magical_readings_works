SCENE II. The same. A street.
  Direction: Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
    PORTIA
        1  Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
        2  And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
        3  And be a day before our husbands home:
        4  This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
  Direction: Enter GRATIANO
    GRATIANO
        5  Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en
        6  My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
        7  Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
        8  Your company at dinner.
    PORTIA
        9  That cannot be:
       10  His ring I do accept most thankfully:
       11  And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
       12  I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.
    GRATIANO
       13  That will I do.
    NERISSA
       14  Sir, I would speak with you.
  Direction: Aside to PORTIA
       15  I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
       16  Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
    PORTIA
       17  [Aside to NERISSA] Thou mayst, I warrant.
       18  We shall have old swearing
       19  That they did give the rings away to men;
       20  But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
  Direction: Aloud
       21  Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.
    NERISSA
       22  Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
  Direction: Exeunt
