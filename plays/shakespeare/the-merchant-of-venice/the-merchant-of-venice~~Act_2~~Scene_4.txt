          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 2 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. The same. A street.
  Direction: Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, and SALANIO
    LORENZO
        1  Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
        2  Disguise us at my lodging and return,
        3  All in an hour.
    GRATIANO
        4  We have not made good preparation.
    SALARINO
        5  We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
    SALANIO
        6  'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
        7  And better in my mind not undertook.
    LORENZO
        8  'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
        9  To furnish us.
  Direction: Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter
       10  Friend Launcelot, what's the news?
    LAUNCELOT
       11  An it shall please you to break up
       12  this, it shall seem to signify.
    LORENZO
       13  I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
       14  And whiter than the paper it writ on
       15  Is the fair hand that writ.
    GRATIANO
       16  Love-news, in faith.
    LAUNCELOT
       17  By your leave, sir.
    LORENZO
       18  Whither goest thou?
    LAUNCELOT
       19  Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
       20  Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.
    LORENZO
       21  Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
       22  I will not fail her; speak it privately.
       23  Go, gentlemen,
  Direction: Exit Launcelot
       24  Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
       25  I am provided of a torch-bearer.
    SALANIO
       26  Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
    SALANIO
       27  And so will I.
    LORENZO
       28  Meet me and Gratiano
       29  At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
    SALARINO
       30  'Tis good we do so.
  Direction: Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO
    GRATIANO
       31  Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
    LORENZO
       32  I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
       33  How I shall take her from her father's house,
       34  What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
       35  What page's suit she hath in readiness.
       36  If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
       37  It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
       38  And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
       39  Unless she do it under this excuse,
       40  That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
       41  Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
       42  Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.
  Direction: Exeunt
