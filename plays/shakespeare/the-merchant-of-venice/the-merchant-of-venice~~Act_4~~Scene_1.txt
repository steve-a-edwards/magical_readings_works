          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.
  Direction: Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others
    DUKE
        1  What, is Antonio here?
    ANTONIO
        2  Ready, so please your grace.
    DUKE
        3  I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
        4  A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
        5  uncapable of pity, void and empty
        6  From any dram of mercy.
    ANTONIO
        7  I have heard
        8  Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
        9  His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
       10  And that no lawful means can carry me
       11  Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
       12  My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
       13  To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
       14  The very tyranny and rage of his.
    DUKE
       15  Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
    SALERIO
       16  He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
  Direction: Enter SHYLOCK
    DUKE
       17  Make room, and let him stand before our face.
       18  Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
       19  That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
       20  To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
       21  Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
       22  Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
       23  And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
       24  Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
       25  Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
       26  But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
       27  Forgive a moiety of the principal;
       28  Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
       29  That have of late so huddled on his back,
       30  Enow to press a royal merchant down
       31  And pluck commiseration of his state
       32  From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
       33  From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
       34  To offices of tender courtesy.
       35  We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
    SHYLOCK
       36  I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
       37  And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
       38  To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
       39  If you deny it, let the danger light
       40  Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
       41  You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
       42  A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
       43  Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
       44  But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
       45  What if my house be troubled with a rat
       46  And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
       47  To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
       48  Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
       49  Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
       50  And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
       51  Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
       52  Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
       53  Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
       54  As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
       55  Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
       56  Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
       57  Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
       58  Must yield to such inevitable shame
       59  As to offend, himself being offended;
       60  So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
       61  More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
       62  I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
       63  A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
    BASSANIO
       64  This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
       65  To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
    SHYLOCK
       66  I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
    BASSANIO
       67  Do all men kill the things they do not love?
    SHYLOCK
       68  Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
    BASSANIO
       69  Every offence is not a hate at first.
    SHYLOCK
       70  What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
    ANTONIO
       71  I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
       72  You may as well go stand upon the beach
       73  And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
       74  You may as well use question with the wolf
       75  Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
       76  You may as well forbid the mountain pines
       77  To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
       78  When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
       79  You may as well do anything most hard,
       80  As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
       81  His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
       82  Make no more offers, use no farther means,
       83  But with all brief and plain conveniency
       84  Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
    BASSANIO
       85  For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
    SHYLOCK
       86  What judgment shall I dread, doing
       87  Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
       88  I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
    DUKE
       89  How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
    SHYLOCK
       90  What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
       91  You have among you many a purchased slave,
       92  Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
       93  You use in abject and in slavish parts,
       94  Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
       95  Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
       96  Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
       97  Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
       98  Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
       99  'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
      100  The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
      101  Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
      102  If you deny me, fie upon your law!
      103  There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
      104  I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
    DUKE
      105  Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
      106  Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
      107  Whom I have sent for to determine this,
      108  Come here to-day.
    SALERIO
      109  My lord, here stays without
      110  A messenger with letters from the doctor,
      111  New come from Padua.
    DUKE
      112  Bring us the letter; call the messenger.
    BASSANIO
      113  Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
      114  The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
      115  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
    ANTONIO
      116  I am a tainted wether of the flock,
      117  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
      118  Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
      119  You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
      120  Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
  Direction: Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk
    DUKE
      121  Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
    NERISSA
      122  From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
  Direction: Presenting a letter
    BASSANIO
      123  Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
    SHYLOCK
      124  To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
    GRATIANO
      125  Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
      126  Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
      127  No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
      128  Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
    SHYLOCK
      129  No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
    GRATIANO
      130  O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
      131  And for thy life let justice be accused.
      132  Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
      133  To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
      134  That souls of animals infuse themselves
      135  Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
      136  Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
      137  Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
      138  And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
      139  Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
      140  Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.
    SHYLOCK
      141  Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
      142  Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
      143  Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
      144  To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
    DUKE
      145  This letter from Bellario doth commend
      146  A young and learned doctor to our court.
      147  Where is he?
    NERISSA
      148  He attendeth here hard by,
      149  To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
    DUKE
      150  With all my heart. Some three or four of you
      151  Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
      152  Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
    Clerk
      153  [Reads]
      154  Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
      155  your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
      156  your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
      157  me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
      158  acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
      159  the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
      160  many books together: he is furnished with my
      161  opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
      162  greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
      163  with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
      164  request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
      165  years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
      166  estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
      167  old a head. I leave him to your gracious
      168  acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
      169  commendation.
    DUKE
      170  You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
      171  And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
  Direction: Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws
      172  Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
    PORTIA
      173  I did, my lord.
    DUKE
      174  You are welcome: take your place.
      175  Are you acquainted with the difference
      176  That holds this present question in the court?
    PORTIA
      177  I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
      178  Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
    DUKE
      179  Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
    PORTIA
      180  Is your name Shylock?
    SHYLOCK
      181  Shylock is my name.
    PORTIA
      182  Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
      183  Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
      184  Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
      185  You stand within his danger, do you not?
    ANTONIO
      186  Ay, so he says.
    PORTIA
      187  Do you confess the bond?
    ANTONIO
      188  I do.
    PORTIA
      189  Then must the Jew be merciful.
    SHYLOCK
      190  On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
    PORTIA
      191  The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
      192  It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
      193  Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
      194  It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
      195  'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
      196  The throned monarch better than his crown;
      197  His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
      198  The attribute to awe and majesty,
      199  Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
      200  But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
      201  It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
      202  It is an attribute to God himself;
      203  And earthly power doth then show likest God's
      204  When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
      205  Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
      206  That, in the course of justice, none of us
      207  Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
      208  And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
      209  The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
      210  To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
      211  Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
      212  Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
    SHYLOCK
      213  My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
      214  The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
    PORTIA
      215  Is he not able to discharge the money?
    BASSANIO
      216  Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
      217  Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
      218  I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
      219  On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
      220  If this will not suffice, it must appear
      221  That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
      222  Wrest once the law to your authority:
      223  To do a great right, do a little wrong,
      224  And curb this cruel devil of his will.
    PORTIA
      225  It must not be; there is no power in Venice
      226  Can alter a decree established:
      227  'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
      228  And many an error by the same example
      229  Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
    SHYLOCK
      230  A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
      231  O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
    PORTIA
      232  I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
    SHYLOCK
      233  Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
    PORTIA
      234  Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.
    SHYLOCK
      235  An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
      236  Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
      237  No, not for Venice.
    PORTIA
      238  Why, this bond is forfeit;
      239  And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
      240  A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
      241  Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
      242  Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
    SHYLOCK
      243  When it is paid according to the tenor.
      244  It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
      245  You know the law, your exposition
      246  Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
      247  Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
      248  Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
      249  There is no power in the tongue of man
      250  To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
    ANTONIO
      251  Most heartily I do beseech the court
      252  To give the judgment.
    PORTIA
      253  Why then, thus it is:
      254  You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
    SHYLOCK
      255  O noble judge! O excellent young man!
    PORTIA
      256  For the intent and purpose of the law
      257  Hath full relation to the penalty,
      258  Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
    SHYLOCK
      259  'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
      260  How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
    PORTIA
      261  Therefore lay bare your bosom.
    SHYLOCK
      262  Ay, his breast:
      263  So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
      264  'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
    PORTIA
      265  It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
      266  The flesh?
    SHYLOCK
      267  I have them ready.
    PORTIA
      268  Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
      269  To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
    SHYLOCK
      270  Is it so nominated in the bond?
    PORTIA
      271  It is not so express'd: but what of that?
      272  'Twere good you do so much for charity.
    SHYLOCK
      273  I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
    PORTIA
      274  You, merchant, have you any thing to say?
    ANTONIO
      275  But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
      276  Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
      277  Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
      278  For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
      279  Than is her custom: it is still her use
      280  To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
      281  To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
      282  An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
      283  Of such misery doth she cut me off.
      284  Commend me to your honourable wife:
      285  Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
      286  Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
      287  And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
      288  Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
      289  Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
      290  And he repents not that he pays your debt;
      291  For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
      292  I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
    BASSANIO
      293  Antonio, I am married to a wife
      294  Which is as dear to me as life itself;
      295  But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
      296  Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
      297  I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
      298  Here to this devil, to deliver you.
    PORTIA
      299  Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
      300  If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
    GRATIANO
      301  I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
      302  I would she were in heaven, so she could
      303  Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
    NERISSA
      304  'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
      305  The wish would make else an unquiet house.
    SHYLOCK
      306  These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
      307  Would any of the stock of Barrabas
      308  Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
  Direction: Aside
      309  We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
    PORTIA
      310  A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
      311  The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
    SHYLOCK
      312  Most rightful judge!
    PORTIA
      313  And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
      314  The law allows it, and the court awards it.
    SHYLOCK
      315  Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!
    PORTIA
      316  Tarry a little; there is something else.
      317  This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
      318  The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
      319  Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
      320  But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
      321  One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
      322  Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
      323  Unto the state of Venice.
    GRATIANO
      324  O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!
    SHYLOCK
      325  Is that the law?
    PORTIA
      326  Thyself shalt see the act:
      327  For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
      328  Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
    GRATIANO
      329  O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!
    SHYLOCK
      330  I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
      331  And let the Christian go.
    BASSANIO
      332  Here is the money.
    PORTIA
      333  Soft!
      334  The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
      335  He shall have nothing but the penalty.
    GRATIANO
      336  O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
    PORTIA
      337  Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
      338  Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
      339  But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
      340  Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
      341  As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
      342  Or the division of the twentieth part
      343  Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
      344  But in the estimation of a hair,
      345  Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
    GRATIANO
      346  A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
      347  Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
    PORTIA
      348  Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
    SHYLOCK
      349  Give me my principal, and let me go.
    BASSANIO
      350  I have it ready for thee; here it is.
    PORTIA
      351  He hath refused it in the open court:
      352  He shall have merely justice and his bond.
    GRATIANO
      353  A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
      354  I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
    SHYLOCK
      355  Shall I not have barely my principal?
    PORTIA
      356  Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
      357  To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
    SHYLOCK
      358  Why, then the devil give him good of it!
      359  I'll stay no longer question.
    PORTIA
      360  Tarry, Jew:
      361  The law hath yet another hold on you.
      362  It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
      363  If it be proved against an alien
      364  That by direct or indirect attempts
      365  He seek the life of any citizen,
      366  The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
      367  Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
      368  Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
      369  And the offender's life lies in the mercy
      370  Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
      371  In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
      372  For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
      373  That indirectly and directly too
      374  Thou hast contrived against the very life
      375  Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
      376  The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
      377  Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
    GRATIANO
      378  Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
      379  And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
      380  Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
      381  Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
    DUKE
      382  That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
      383  I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
      384  For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
      385  The other half comes to the general state,
      386  Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
    PORTIA
      387  Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
    SHYLOCK
      388  Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
      389  You take my house when you do take the prop
      390  That doth sustain my house; you take my life
      391  When you do take the means whereby I live.
    PORTIA
      392  What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
    GRATIANO
      393  A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.
    ANTONIO
      394  So please my lord the duke and all the court
      395  To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
      396  I am content; so he will let me have
      397  The other half in use, to render it,
      398  Upon his death, unto the gentleman
      399  That lately stole his daughter:
      400  Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
      401  He presently become a Christian;
      402  The other, that he do record a gift,
      403  Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
      404  Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
    DUKE
      405  He shall do this, or else I do recant
      406  The pardon that I late pronounced here.
    PORTIA
      407  Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?
    SHYLOCK
      408  I am content.
    PORTIA
      409  Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
    SHYLOCK
      410  I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
      411  I am not well: send the deed after me,
      412  And I will sign it.
    DUKE
      413  Get thee gone, but do it.
    GRATIANO
      414  In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
      415  Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
      416  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
  Direction: Exit SHYLOCK
    DUKE
      417  Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
    PORTIA
      418  I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
      419  I must away this night toward Padua,
      420  And it is meet I presently set forth.
    DUKE
      421  I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
      422  Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
      423  For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
  Direction: Exeunt Duke and his train
    BASSANIO
      424  Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
      425  Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
      426  Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
      427  Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
      428  We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
    ANTONIO
      429  And stand indebted, over and above,
      430  In love and service to you evermore.
    PORTIA
      431  He is well paid that is well satisfied;
      432  And I, delivering you, am satisfied
      433  And therein do account myself well paid:
      434  My mind was never yet more mercenary.
      435  I pray you, know me when we meet again:
      436  I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
    BASSANIO
      437  Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
      438  Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
      439  Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
      440  Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
    PORTIA
      441  You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
  Direction: To ANTONIO
      442  Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
  Direction: To BASSANIO
      443  And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
      444  Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
      445  And you in love shall not deny me this.
    BASSANIO
      446  This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
      447  I will not shame myself to give you this.
    PORTIA
      448  I will have nothing else but only this;
      449  And now methinks I have a mind to it.
    BASSANIO
      450  There's more depends on this than on the value.
      451  The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
      452  And find it out by proclamation:
      453  Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
    PORTIA
      454  I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
      455  You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
      456  You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
    BASSANIO
      457  Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
      458  And when she put it on, she made me vow
      459  That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
    PORTIA
      460  That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
      461  An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
      462  And know how well I have deserved the ring,
      463  She would not hold out enemy for ever,
      464  For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
  Direction: Exeunt Portia and Nerissa
    ANTONIO
      465  My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
      466  Let his deservings and my love withal
      467  Be valued against your wife's commandment.
    BASSANIO
      468  Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
      469  Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
      470  Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
  Direction: Exit Gratiano
      471  Come, you and I will thither presently;
      472  And in the morning early will we both
      473  Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.
  Direction: Exeunt
