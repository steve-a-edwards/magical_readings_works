          The Merchant Of Venice : Act 3 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
  Direction: Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASAR
    LORENZO
        1  Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
        2  You have a noble and a true conceit
        3  Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
        4  In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
        5  But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
        6  How true a gentleman you send relief,
        7  How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
        8  I know you would be prouder of the work
        9  Than customary bounty can enforce you.
    PORTIA
       10  I never did repent for doing good,
       11  Nor shall not now: for in companions
       12  That do converse and waste the time together,
       13  Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
       14  There must be needs a like proportion
       15  Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
       16  Which makes me think that this Antonio,
       17  Being the bosom lover of my lord,
       18  Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
       19  How little is the cost I have bestow'd
       20  In purchasing the semblance of my soul
       21  From out the state of hellish misery!
       22  This comes too near the praising of myself;
       23  Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
       24  Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
       25  The husbandry and manage of my house
       26  Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
       27  I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
       28  To live in prayer and contemplation,
       29  Only attended by Nerissa here,
       30  Until her husband and my lord's return:
       31  There is a monastery two miles off;
       32  And there will we abide. I do desire you
       33  Not to deny this imposition;
       34  The which my love and some necessity
       35  Now lays upon you.
    LORENZO
       36  Madam, with all my heart;
       37  I shall obey you in all fair commands.
    PORTIA
       38  My people do already know my mind,
       39  And will acknowledge you and Jessica
       40  In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
       41  And so farewell, till we shall meet again.
    LORENZO
       42  Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
    JESSICA
       43  I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
    PORTIA
       44  I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
       45  To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
  Direction: Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO
       46  Now, Balthasar,
       47  As I have ever found thee honest-true,
       48  So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
       49  And use thou all the endeavour of a man
       50  In speed to Padua: see thou render this
       51  Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;
       52  And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
       53  Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
       54  Unto the tranect, to the common ferry
       55  Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
       56  But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.
    BALTHASAR
       57  Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
  Direction: Exit
    PORTIA
       58  Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
       59  That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
       60  Before they think of us.
    NERISSA
       61  Shall they see us?
    PORTIA
       62  They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
       63  That they shall think we are accomplished
       64  With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
       65  When we are both accoutred like young men,
       66  I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
       67  And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
       68  And speak between the change of man and boy
       69  With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
       70  Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
       71  Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
       72  How honourable ladies sought my love,
       73  Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
       74  I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
       75  And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;
       76  And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
       77  That men shall swear I have discontinued school
       78  Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
       79  A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
       80  Which I will practise.
    NERISSA
       81  Why, shall we turn to men?
    PORTIA
       82  Fie, what a question's that,
       83  If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
       84  But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
       85  When I am in my coach, which stays for us
       86  At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
       87  For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
  Direction: Exeunt
