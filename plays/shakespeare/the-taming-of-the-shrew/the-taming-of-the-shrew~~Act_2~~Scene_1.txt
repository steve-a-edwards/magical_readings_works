          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.
  Direction: Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA
    BIANCA
        1  Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
        2  To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
        3  That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
        4  Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
        5  Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
        6  Or what you will command me will I do,
        7  So well I know my duty to my elders.
    KATHARINA
        8  Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
        9  Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
    BIANCA
       10  Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
       11  I never yet beheld that special face
       12  Which I could fancy more than any other.
    KATHARINA
       13  Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
    BIANCA
       14  If you affect him, sister, here I swear
       15  I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
       16  him.
    KATHARINA
       17  O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
       18  You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
    BIANCA
       19  Is it for him you do envy me so?
       20  Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
       21  You have but jested with me all this while:
       22  I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
    KATHARINA
       23  If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
  Direction: Strikes her
  Direction: Enter BAPTISTA
    BAPTISTA
       24  Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
       25  Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
       26  Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
       27  For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
       28  Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
       29  When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
    KATHARINA
       30  Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
  Direction: Flies after BIANCA
    BAPTISTA
       31  What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
  Direction: Exit BIANCA
    KATHARINA
       32  What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
       33  She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
       34  I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
       35  And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
       36  Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
       37  Till I can find occasion of revenge.
  Direction: Exit
    BAPTISTA
       38  Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
       39  But who comes here?
  Direction: Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man; PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO, with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books
    GREMIO
       40  Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
    BAPTISTA
       41  Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
       42  God save you, gentlemen!
    PETRUCHIO
       43  And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
       44  Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?
    BAPTISTA
       45  I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.
    GREMIO
       46  You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
    PETRUCHIO
       47  You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
       48  I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
       49  That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
       50  Her affability and bashful modesty,
       51  Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
       52  Am bold to show myself a forward guest
       53  Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
       54  Of that report which I so oft have heard.
       55  And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
       56  I do present you with a man of mine,
  Direction: Presenting HORTENSIO
       57  Cunning in music and the mathematics,
       58  To instruct her fully in those sciences,
       59  Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
       60  Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
       61  His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
    BAPTISTA
       62  You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
       63  But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
       64  She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
    PETRUCHIO
       65  I see you do not mean to part with her,
       66  Or else you like not of my company.
    BAPTISTA
       67  Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
       68  Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
    PETRUCHIO
       69  Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
       70  A man well known throughout all Italy.
    BAPTISTA
       71  I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
    GREMIO
       72  Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
       73  Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
       74  Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
    PETRUCHIO
       75  O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
    GREMIO
       76  I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
       77  wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
       78  sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
       79  that have been more kindly beholding to you than
       80  any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
  Direction: Presenting LUCENTIO
       81  that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
       82  in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
       83  in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
       84  accept his service.
    BAPTISTA
       85  A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
       86  Welcome, good Cambio.
  Direction: To TRANIO
       87  But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
       88  may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
    TRANIO
       89  Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
       90  That, being a stranger in this city here,
       91  Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
       92  Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
       93  Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
       94  In the preferment of the eldest sister.
       95  This liberty is all that I request,
       96  That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
       97  I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
       98  And free access and favour as the rest:
       99  And, toward the education of your daughters,
      100  I here bestow a simple instrument,
      101  And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
      102  If you accept them, then their worth is great.
    BAPTISTA
      103  Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?
    TRANIO
      104  Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
    BAPTISTA
      105  A mighty man of Pisa; by report
      106  I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
      107  Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
      108  You shall go see your pupils presently.
      109  Holla, within!
  Direction: Enter a Servant
      110  Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
      111  To my daughters; and tell them both,
      112  These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
  Direction: Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following
      113  We will go walk a little in the orchard,
      114  And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
      115  And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
    PETRUCHIO
      116  Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
      117  And every day I cannot come to woo.
      118  You knew my father well, and in him me,
      119  Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
      120  Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
      121  Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
      122  What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
    BAPTISTA
      123  After my death the one half of my lands,
      124  And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
    PETRUCHIO
      125  And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
      126  Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
      127  In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
      128  Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
      129  That covenants may be kept on either hand.
    BAPTISTA
      130  Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
      131  That is, her love; for that is all in all.
    PETRUCHIO
      132  Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
      133  I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
      134  And where two raging fires meet together
      135  They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
      136  Though little fire grows great with little wind,
      137  Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
      138  So I to her and so she yields to me;
      139  For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
    BAPTISTA
      140  Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
      141  But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
    PETRUCHIO
      142  Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
      143  That shake not, though they blow perpetually.
  Direction: Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke
    BAPTISTA
      144  How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
    HORTENSIO
      145  For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
    BAPTISTA
      146  What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
    HORTENSIO
      147  I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
      148  Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
    BAPTISTA
      149  Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
    HORTENSIO
      150  Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
      151  I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
      152  And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
      153  When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
      154  'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
      155  with them:'
      156  And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
      157  And through the instrument my pate made way;
      158  And there I stood amazed for a while,
      159  As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
      160  While she did call me rascal fiddler
      161  And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
      162  As had she studied to misuse me so.
    PETRUCHIO
      163  Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
      164  I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
      165  O, how I long to have some chat with her!
    BAPTISTA
      166  Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
      167  Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
      168  She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
      169  Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
      170  Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
    PETRUCHIO
      171  I pray you do.
  Direction: Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
      172  I will attend her here,
      173  And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
      174  Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
      175  She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
      176  Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
      177  As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
      178  Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
      179  Then I'll commend her volubility,
      180  And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
      181  If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
      182  As though she bid me stay by her a week:
      183  If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
      184  When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
      185  But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
  Direction: Enter KATHARINA
      186  Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.
    KATHARINA
      187  Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
      188  They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
    PETRUCHIO
      189  You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
      190  And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
      191  But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
      192  Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
      193  For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
      194  Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
      195  Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
      196  Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
      197  Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
      198  Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
    KATHARINA
      199  Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
      200  Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
      201  You were a moveable.
    PETRUCHIO
      202  Why, what's a moveable?
    KATHARINA
      203  A join'd-stool.
    PETRUCHIO
      204  Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.
    KATHARINA
      205  Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
    PETRUCHIO
      206  Women are made to bear, and so are you.
    KATHARINA
      207  No such jade as you, if me you mean.
    PETRUCHIO
      208  Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
      209  For, knowing thee to be but young and light--
    KATHARINA
      210  Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
      211  And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
    PETRUCHIO
      212  Should be! should--buzz!
    KATHARINA
      213  Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
    PETRUCHIO
      214  O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
    KATHARINA
      215  Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
    PETRUCHIO
      216  Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
    KATHARINA
      217  If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
    PETRUCHIO
      218  My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
    KATHARINA
      219  Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
    PETRUCHIO
      220  Who knows not where a wasp does
      221  wear his sting? In his tail.
    KATHARINA
      222  In his tongue.
    PETRUCHIO
      223  Whose tongue?
    KATHARINA
      224  Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
    PETRUCHIO
      225  What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
      226  Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
    KATHARINA
      227  That I'll try.
  Direction: She strikes him
    PETRUCHIO
      228  I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
    KATHARINA
      229  So may you lose your arms:
      230  If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
      231  And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
    PETRUCHIO
      232  A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
    KATHARINA
      233  What is your crest? a coxcomb?
    PETRUCHIO
      234  A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
    KATHARINA
      235  No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.
    PETRUCHIO
      236  Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
    KATHARINA
      237  It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
    PETRUCHIO
      238  Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
    KATHARINA
      239  There is, there is.
    PETRUCHIO
      240  Then show it me.
    KATHARINA
      241  Had I a glass, I would.
    PETRUCHIO
      242  What, you mean my face?
    KATHARINA
      243  Well aim'd of such a young one.
    PETRUCHIO
      244  Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
    KATHARINA
      245  Yet you are wither'd.
    PETRUCHIO
      246  'Tis with cares.
    KATHARINA
      247  I care not.
    PETRUCHIO
      248  Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.
    KATHARINA
      249  I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
    PETRUCHIO
      250  No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
      251  'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
      252  And now I find report a very liar;
      253  For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
      254  But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
      255  Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
      256  Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
      257  Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
      258  But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
      259  With gentle conference, soft and affable.
      260  Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
      261  O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
      262  Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
      263  As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
      264  O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.
    KATHARINA
      265  Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
    PETRUCHIO
      266  Did ever Dian so become a grove
      267  As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
      268  O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
      269  And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
    KATHARINA
      270  Where did you study all this goodly speech?
    PETRUCHIO
      271  It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
    KATHARINA
      272  A witty mother! witless else her son.
    PETRUCHIO
      273  Am I not wise?
    KATHARINA
      274  Yes; keep you warm.
    PETRUCHIO
      275  Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
      276  And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
      277  Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
      278  That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
      279  And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
      280  Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
      281  For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
      282  Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
      283  Thou must be married to no man but me;
      284  For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
      285  And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
      286  Conformable as other household Kates.
      287  Here comes your father: never make denial;
      288  I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
  Direction: Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO
    BAPTISTA
      289  Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
    PETRUCHIO
      290  How but well, sir? how but well?
      291  It were impossible I should speed amiss.
    BAPTISTA
      292  Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?
    KATHARINA
      293  Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
      294  You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
      295  To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
      296  A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
      297  That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
    PETRUCHIO
      298  Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
      299  That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
      300  If she be curst, it is for policy,
      301  For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
      302  She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
      303  For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
      304  And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
      305  And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
      306  That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
    KATHARINA
      307  I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
    GREMIO
      308  Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
      309  hang'd first.
    TRANIO
      310  Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
    PETRUCHIO
      311  Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
      312  If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
      313  'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
      314  That she shall still be curst in company.
      315  I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
      316  How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
      317  She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
      318  She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
      319  That in a twink she won me to her love.
      320  O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
      321  How tame, when men and women are alone,
      322  A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
      323  Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
      324  To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
      325  Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
      326  I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.
    BAPTISTA
      327  I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
      328  God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.
    GREMIO and TRANIO
      329  Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
    PETRUCHIO
      330  Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
      331  I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
      332  We will have rings and things and fine array;
      333  And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.
  Direction: Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally
    GREMIO
      334  Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
    BAPTISTA
      335  Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
      336  And venture madly on a desperate mart.
    TRANIO
      337  'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
      338  'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
    BAPTISTA
      339  The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
    GREMIO
      340  No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
      341  But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
      342  Now is the day we long have looked for:
      343  I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
    TRANIO
      344  And I am one that love Bianca more
      345  Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.
    GREMIO
      346  Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
    TRANIO
      347  Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
    GREMIO
      348  But thine doth fry.
      349  Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.
    TRANIO
      350  But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
    BAPTISTA
      351  Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
      352  'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
      353  That can assure my daughter greatest dower
      354  Shall have my Bianca's love.
      355  Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?
    GREMIO
      356  First, as you know, my house within the city
      357  Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
      358  Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
      359  My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
      360  In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
      361  In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
      362  Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
      363  Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
      364  Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
      365  Pewter and brass and all things that belong
      366  To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
      367  I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
      368  Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
      369  And all things answerable to this portion.
      370  Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
      371  And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
      372  If whilst I live she will be only mine.
    TRANIO
      373  That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
      374  I am my father's heir and only son:
      375  If I may have your daughter to my wife,
      376  I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
      377  Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
      378  Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
      379  Besides two thousand ducats by the year
      380  Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
      381  What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
    GREMIO
      382  Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
      383  My land amounts not to so much in all:
      384  That she shall have; besides an argosy
      385  That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
      386  What, have I choked you with an argosy?
    TRANIO
      387  Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
      388  Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
      389  And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
      390  And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
    GREMIO
      391  Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
      392  And she can have no more than all I have:
      393  If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
    TRANIO
      394  Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
      395  By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.
    BAPTISTA
      396  I must confess your offer is the best;
      397  And, let your father make her the assurance,
      398  She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
      399  if you should die before him, where's her dower?
    TRANIO
      400  That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
    GREMIO
      401  And may not young men die, as well as old?
    BAPTISTA
      402  Well, gentlemen,
      403  I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
      404  My daughter Katharina is to be married:
      405  Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
      406  Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
      407  If not, Signior Gremio:
      408  And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
    GREMIO
      409  Adieu, good neighbour.
  Direction: Exit BAPTISTA
      410  Now I fear thee not:
      411  Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
      412  To give thee all, and in his waning age
      413  Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
      414  An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
  Direction: Exit
    TRANIO
      415  A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
      416  Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
      417  'Tis in my head to do my master good:
      418  I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
      419  Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
      420  And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
      421  Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
      422  A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
  Direction: Exit
