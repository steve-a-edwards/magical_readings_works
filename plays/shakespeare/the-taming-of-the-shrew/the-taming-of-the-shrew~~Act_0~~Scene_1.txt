          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 0 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.
  Direction: Enter Hostess and SLY
    SLY
        1  I'll pheeze you, in faith.
    Hostess
        2  A pair of stocks, you rogue!
    SLY
        3  Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
        4  the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
        5  Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!
    Hostess
        6  You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
    SLY
        7  No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
        8  bed, and warm thee.
    Hostess
        9  I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
       10  third--borough.
  Direction: Exit
    SLY
       11  Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
       12  by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
       13  and kindly.
  Direction: Falls asleep
  Direction: Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train
    Lord
       14  Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
       15  Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
       16  And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
       17  Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
       18  At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
       19  I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
    First Huntsman
       20  Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
       21  He cried upon it at the merest loss
       22  And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
       23  Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
    Lord
       24  Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
       25  I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
       26  But sup them well and look unto them all:
       27  To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
    First Huntsman
       28  I will, my lord.
    Lord
       29  What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?
    Second Huntsman
       30  He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
       31  This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
    Lord
       32  O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
       33  Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
       34  Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
       35  What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
       36  Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
       37  A most delicious banquet by his bed,
       38  And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
       39  Would not the beggar then forget himself?
    First Huntsman
       40  Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
    Second Huntsman
       41  It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
    Lord
       42  Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
       43  Then take him up and manage well the jest:
       44  Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
       45  And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
       46  Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
       47  And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
       48  Procure me music ready when he wakes,
       49  To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
       50  And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
       51  And with a low submissive reverence
       52  Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
       53  Let one attend him with a silver basin
       54  Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
       55  Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
       56  And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
       57  Some one be ready with a costly suit
       58  And ask him what apparel he will wear;
       59  Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
       60  And that his lady mourns at his disease:
       61  Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
       62  And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
       63  For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
       64  This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
       65  It will be pastime passing excellent,
       66  If it be husbanded with modesty.
    First Huntsman
       67  My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
       68  As he shall think by our true diligence
       69  He is no less than what we say he is.
    Lord
       70  Take him up gently and to bed with him;
       71  And each one to his office when he wakes.
  Direction: Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds
       72  Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
  Direction: Exit Servingman
       73  Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
       74  Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
  Direction: Re-enter Servingman
       75  How now! who is it?
    Servant
       76  An't please your honour, players
       77  That offer service to your lordship.
    Lord
       78  Bid them come near.
  Direction: Enter Players
       79  Now, fellows, you are welcome.
    Players
       80  We thank your honour.
    Lord
       81  Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
    A Player
       82  So please your lordship to accept our duty.
    Lord
       83  With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
       84  Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
       85  'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
       86  I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
       87  Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
    A Player
       88  I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
    Lord
       89  'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
       90  Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
       91  The rather for I have some sport in hand
       92  Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
       93  There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
       94  But I am doubtful of your modesties;
       95  Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
       96  For yet his honour never heard a play--
       97  You break into some merry passion
       98  And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
       99  If you should smile he grows impatient.
    A Player
      100  Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
      101  Were he the veriest antic in the world.
    Lord
      102  Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
      103  And give them friendly welcome every one:
      104  Let them want nothing that my house affords.
  Direction: Exit one with the Players
      105  Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
      106  And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
      107  That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
      108  And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
      109  Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
      110  He bear himself with honourable action,
      111  Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
      112  Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
      113  Such duty to the drunkard let him do
      114  With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
      115  And say 'What is't your honour will command,
      116  Wherein your lady and your humble wife
      117  May show her duty and make known her love?'
      118  And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
      119  And with declining head into his bosom,
      120  Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
      121  To see her noble lord restored to health,
      122  Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
      123  No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
      124  And if the boy have not a woman's gift
      125  To rain a shower of commanded tears,
      126  An onion will do well for such a shift,
      127  Which in a napkin being close convey'd
      128  Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
      129  See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
      130  Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
  Direction: Exit a Servingman
      131  I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
      132  Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
      133  I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
      134  And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
      135  When they do homage to this simple peasant.
      136  I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
      137  May well abate the over-merry spleen
      138  Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
  Direction: Exeunt
