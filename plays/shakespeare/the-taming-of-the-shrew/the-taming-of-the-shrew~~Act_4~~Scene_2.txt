          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
  Direction: Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO
    TRANIO
        1  Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
        2  Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
        3  I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
    HORTENSIO
        4  Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
        5  Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
  Direction: Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO
    LUCENTIO
        6  Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
    BIANCA
        7  What, master, read you? first resolve me that.
    LUCENTIO
        8  I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
    BIANCA
        9  And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
    LUCENTIO
       10  While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!
    HORTENSIO
       11  Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
       12  You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
       13  Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.
    TRANIO
       14  O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
       15  I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
    HORTENSIO
       16  Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
       17  Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
       18  But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
       19  For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
       20  And makes a god of such a cullion:
       21  Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
    TRANIO
       22  Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
       23  Of your entire affection to Bianca;
       24  And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
       25  I will with you, if you be so contented,
       26  Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
    HORTENSIO
       27  See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
       28  Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
       29  Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
       30  As one unworthy all the former favours
       31  That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
    TRANIO
       32  And here I take the unfeigned oath,
       33  Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
       34  Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!
    HORTENSIO
       35  Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
       36  For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
       37  I will be married to a wealthy widow,
       38  Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
       39  As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
       40  And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
       41  Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
       42  Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
       43  In resolution as I swore before.
  Direction: Exit
    TRANIO
       44  Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
       45  As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
       46  Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
       47  And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
    BIANCA
       48  Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
    TRANIO
       49  Mistress, we have.
    LUCENTIO
       50  Then we are rid of Licio.
    TRANIO
       51  I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
       52  That shall be wood and wedded in a day.
    BIANCA
       53  God give him joy!
    TRANIO
       54  Ay, and he'll tame her.
    BIANCA
       55  He says so, Tranio.
    TRANIO
       56  Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
    BIANCA
       57  The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
    TRANIO
       58  Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
       59  That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
       60  To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
  Direction: Enter BIONDELLO
    BIONDELLO
       61  O master, master, I have watch'd so long
       62  That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
       63  An ancient angel coming down the hill,
       64  Will serve the turn.
    TRANIO
       65  What is he, Biondello?
    BIONDELLO
       66  Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
       67  I know not what; but format in apparel,
       68  In gait and countenance surely like a father.
    LUCENTIO
       69  And what of him, Tranio?
    TRANIO
       70  If he be credulous and trust my tale,
       71  I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
       72  And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
       73  As if he were the right Vincentio
       74  Take in your love, and then let me alone.
  Direction: Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
  Direction: Enter a Pedant
    Pedant
       75  God save you, sir!
    TRANIO
       76  And you, sir! you are welcome.
       77  Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
    Pedant
       78  Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
       79  But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
       80  And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
    TRANIO
       81  What countryman, I pray?
    Pedant
       82  Of Mantua.
    TRANIO
       83  Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
       84  And come to Padua, careless of your life?
    Pedant
       85  My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
    TRANIO
       86  'Tis death for any one in Mantua
       87  To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
       88  Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
       89  For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
       90  Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
       91  'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
       92  You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
    Pedant
       93  Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
       94  For I have bills for money by exchange
       95  From Florence and must here deliver them.
    TRANIO
       96  Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
       97  This will I do, and this I will advise you:
       98  First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
    Pedant
       99  Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
      100  Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
    TRANIO
      101  Among them know you one Vincentio?
    Pedant
      102  I know him not, but I have heard of him;
      103  A merchant of incomparable wealth.
    TRANIO
      104  He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
      105  In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
    BIONDELLO
      106  [Aside] As much as an apple doth an oyster,
      107  and all one.
    TRANIO
      108  To save your life in this extremity,
      109  This favour will I do you for his sake;
      110  And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
      111  That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
      112  His name and credit shall you undertake,
      113  And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
      114  Look that you take upon you as you should;
      115  You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
      116  Till you have done your business in the city:
      117  If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
    Pedant
      118  O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
      119  The patron of my life and liberty.
    TRANIO
      120  Then go with me to make the matter good.
      121  This, by the way, I let you understand;
      122  my father is here look'd for every day,
      123  To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
      124  'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
      125  In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
      126  Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.
  Direction: Exeunt
