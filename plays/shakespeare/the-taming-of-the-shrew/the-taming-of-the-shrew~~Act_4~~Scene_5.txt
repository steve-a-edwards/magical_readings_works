          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 4 : Scene 5

SCENE V. A public road.
  Direction: Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Servants
    PETRUCHIO
        1  Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
        2  Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
    KATHARINA
        3  The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
    PETRUCHIO
        4  I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
    KATHARINA
        5  I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
    PETRUCHIO
        6  Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
        7  It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
        8  Or ere I journey to your father's house.
        9  Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
       10  Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
    HORTENSIO
       11  Say as he says, or we shall never go.
    KATHARINA
       12  Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
       13  And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
       14  An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
       15  Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
    PETRUCHIO
       16  I say it is the moon.
    KATHARINA
       17  I know it is the moon.
    PETRUCHIO
       18  Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.
    KATHARINA
       19  Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
       20  But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
       21  And the moon changes even as your mind.
       22  What you will have it named, even that it is;
       23  And so it shall be so for Katharina.
    HORTENSIO
       24  Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.
    PETRUCHIO
       25  Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
       26  And not unluckily against the bias.
       27  But, soft! company is coming here.
  Direction: Enter VINCENTIO
  Direction: To VINCENTIO
       28  Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
       29  Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
       30  Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
       31  Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
       32  What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
       33  As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
       34  Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
       35  Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
    HORTENSIO
       36  A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
    KATHARINA
       37  Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
       38  Whither away, or where is thy abode?
       39  Happy the parents of so fair a child;
       40  Happier the man, whom favourable stars
       41  Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!
    PETRUCHIO
       42  Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
       43  This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
       44  And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.
    KATHARINA
       45  Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
       46  That have been so bedazzled with the sun
       47  That everything I look on seemeth green:
       48  Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
       49  Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
    PETRUCHIO
       50  Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
       51  Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
       52  We shall be joyful of thy company.
    VINCENTIO
       53  Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
       54  That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
       55  My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
       56  And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
       57  A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
    PETRUCHIO
       58  What is his name?
    VINCENTIO
       59  Lucentio, gentle sir.
    PETRUCHIO
       60  Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
       61  And now by law, as well as reverend age,
       62  I may entitle thee my loving father:
       63  The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
       64  Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
       65  Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
       66  Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
       67  Beside, so qualified as may beseem
       68  The spouse of any noble gentleman.
       69  Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
       70  And wander we to see thy honest son,
       71  Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
    VINCENTIO
       72  But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
       73  Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
       74  Upon the company you overtake?
    HORTENSIO
       75  I do assure thee, father, so it is.
    PETRUCHIO
       76  Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
       77  For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
  Direction: Exeunt all but HORTENSIO
    HORTENSIO
       78  Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
       79  Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
       80  Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.
  Direction: Exit
