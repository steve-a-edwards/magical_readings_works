          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 3 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
  Direction: Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, LUCENTIO, and others, attendants
    BAPTISTA
        1  [To TRANIO] Signior Lucentio, this is the
        2  'pointed day.
        3  That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,
        4  And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
        5  What will be said? what mockery will it be,
        6  To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
        7  To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
        8  What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
    KATHARINA
        9  No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
       10  To give my hand opposed against my heart
       11  Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
       12  Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
       13  I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
       14  Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
       15  And, to be noted for a merry man,
       16  He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
       17  Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
       18  Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
       19  Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
       20  And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
       21  If it would please him come and marry her!'
    TRANIO
       22  Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
       23  Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
       24  Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
       25  Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
       26  Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
    KATHARINA
       27  Would Katharina had never seen him though!
  Direction: Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others
    BAPTISTA
       28  Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
       29  For such an injury would vex a very saint,
       30  Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
  Direction: Enter BIONDELLO
    BIONDELLO
       31  Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
       32  you never heard of!
    BAPTISTA
       33  Is it new and old too? how may that be?
    BIONDELLO
       34  Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?
    BAPTISTA
       35  Is he come?
    BIONDELLO
       36  Why, no, sir.
    BAPTISTA
       37  What then?
    BIONDELLO
       38  He is coming.
    BAPTISTA
       39  When will he be here?
    BIONDELLO
       40  When he stands where I am and sees you there.
    TRANIO
       41  But say, what to thine old news?
    BIONDELLO
       42  Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
       43  jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
       44  of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
       45  another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
       46  town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
       47  with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
       48  old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
       49  besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
       50  in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
       51  with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
       52  spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
       53  stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
       54  bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
       55  near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
       56  and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
       57  restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
       58  often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
       59  six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
       60  which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
       61  in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.
    BAPTISTA
       62  Who comes with him?
    BIONDELLO
       63  O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
       64  like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
       65  kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
       66  and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
       67  fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
       68  very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
       69  footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
    TRANIO
       70  'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
       71  Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.
    BAPTISTA
       72  I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
    BIONDELLO
       73  Why, sir, he comes not.
    BAPTISTA
       74  Didst thou not say he comes?
    BIONDELLO
       75  Who? that Petruchio came?
    BAPTISTA
       76  Ay, that Petruchio came.
    BIONDELLO
       77  No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
    BAPTISTA
       78  Why, that's all one.
    BIONDELLO
       79  Nay, by Saint Jamy,
       80  I hold you a penny,
       81  A horse and a man
       82  Is more than one,
       83  And yet not many.
  Direction: Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
    PETRUCHIO
       84  Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?
    BAPTISTA
       85  You are welcome, sir.
    PETRUCHIO
       86  And yet I come not well.
    BAPTISTA
       87  And yet you halt not.
    TRANIO
       88  Not so well apparell'd
       89  As I wish you were.
    PETRUCHIO
       90  Were it better, I should rush in thus.
       91  But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
       92  How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
       93  And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
       94  As if they saw some wondrous monument,
       95  Some comet or unusual prodigy?
    BAPTISTA
       96  Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
       97  First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
       98  Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
       99  Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
      100  An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
    TRANIO
      101  And tells us, what occasion of import
      102  Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
      103  And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
    PETRUCHIO
      104  Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
      105  Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
      106  Though in some part enforced to digress;
      107  Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
      108  As you shall well be satisfied withal.
      109  But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
      110  The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
    TRANIO
      111  See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
      112  Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.
    PETRUCHIO
      113  Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
    BAPTISTA
      114  But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
    PETRUCHIO
      115  Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
      116  To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
      117  Could I repair what she will wear in me,
      118  As I can change these poor accoutrements,
      119  'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
      120  But what a fool am I to chat with you,
      121  When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
      122  And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
  Direction: Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
    TRANIO
      123  He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
      124  We will persuade him, be it possible,
      125  To put on better ere he go to church.
    BAPTISTA
      126  I'll after him, and see the event of this.
  Direction: Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants
    TRANIO
      127  But to her love concerneth us to add
      128  Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
      129  As I before unparted to your worship,
      130  I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
      131  It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
      132  And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
      133  And make assurance here in Padua
      134  Of greater sums than I have promised.
      135  So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
      136  And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
    LUCENTIO
      137  Were it not that my fellow-school-master
      138  Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
      139  'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
      140  Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
      141  I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.
    TRANIO
      142  That by degrees we mean to look into,
      143  And watch our vantage in this business:
      144  We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
      145  The narrow-prying father, Minola,
      146  The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
      147  All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
  Direction: Re-enter GREMIO
      148  Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
    GREMIO
      149  As willingly as e'er I came from school.
    TRANIO
      150  And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
    GREMIO
      151  A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
      152  A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
    TRANIO
      153  Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
    GREMIO
      154  Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
    TRANIO
      155  Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
    GREMIO
      156  Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
      157  I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
      158  Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
      159  'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
      160  That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
      161  And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
      162  The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
      163  That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
      164  'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'
    TRANIO
      165  What said the wench when he rose again?
    GREMIO
      166  Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
      167  As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
      168  But after many ceremonies done,
      169  He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
      170  He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
      171  After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
      172  And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
      173  Having no other reason
      174  But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
      175  And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
      176  This done, he took the bride about the neck
      177  And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
      178  That at the parting all the church did echo:
      179  And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
      180  And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
      181  Such a mad marriage never was before:
      182  Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.

    PETRUCHIO
      183  Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
      184  I know you think to dine with me to-day,
      185  And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
      186  But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
      187  And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
    BAPTISTA
      188  Is't possible you will away to-night?
    PETRUCHIO
      189  I must away to-day, before night come:
      190  Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
      191  You would entreat me rather go than stay.
      192  And, honest company, I thank you all,
      193  That have beheld me give away myself
      194  To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
      195  Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
      196  For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
    TRANIO
      197  Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
    PETRUCHIO
      198  It may not be.
    GREMIO
      199  Let me entreat you.
    PETRUCHIO
      200  It cannot be.
    KATHARINA
      201  Let me entreat you.
    PETRUCHIO
      202  I am content.
    KATHARINA
      203  Are you content to stay?
    PETRUCHIO
      204  I am content you shall entreat me stay;
      205  But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
    KATHARINA
      206  Now, if you love me, stay.
    PETRUCHIO
      207  Grumio, my horse.
    GRUMIO
      208  Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.
    KATHARINA
      209  Nay, then,
      210  Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
      211  No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
      212  The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
      213  You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
      214  For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
      215  'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
      216  That take it on you at the first so roundly.
    PETRUCHIO
      217  O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.
    KATHARINA
      218  I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
      219  Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
    GREMIO
      220  Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
    KATARINA
      221  Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
      222  I see a woman may be made a fool,
      223  If she had not a spirit to resist.
    PETRUCHIO
      224  They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
      225  Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
      226  Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
      227  Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
      228  Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
      229  But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
      230  Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
      231  I will be master of what is mine own:
      232  She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
      233  My household stuff, my field, my barn,
      234  My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
      235  And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
      236  I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
      237  That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
      238  Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
      239  Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
      240  Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
      241  thee, Kate:
      242  I'll buckler thee against a million.
  Direction: Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, and GRUMIO
    BAPTISTA
      243  Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
    GREMIO
      244  Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
    TRANIO
      245  Of all mad matches never was the like.
    LUCENTIO
      246  Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
    BIANCA
      247  That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
    GREMIO
      248  I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
    BAPTISTA
      249  Neighbours and friends, though bride and
      250  bridegroom wants
      251  For to supply the places at the table,
      252  You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
      253  Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:
      254  And let Bianca take her sister's room.
    TRANIO
      255  Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
    BAPTISTA
      256  She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
