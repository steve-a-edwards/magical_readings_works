          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house.
  Direction: GREMIO discovered. Enter behind BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA
    BIONDELLO
        1  Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.
    LUCENTIO
        2  I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
        3  at home; therefore leave us.
    BIONDELLO
        4  Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
        5  then come back to my master's as soon as I can.
  Direction: Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO
    GREMIO
        6  I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
  Direction: Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO, with Attendants
    PETRUCHIO
        7  Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
        8  My father's bears more toward the market-place;
        9  Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
    VINCENTIO
       10  You shall not choose but drink before you go:
       11  I think I shall command your welcome here,
       12  And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
  Direction: Knocks
    GREMIO
       13  They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
  Direction: Pedant looks out of the window
    Pedant
       14  What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
    VINCENTIO
       15  Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
    Pedant
       16  He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
    VINCENTIO
       17  What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
       18  make merry withal?
    Pedant
       19  Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
       20  need none, so long as I live.
    PETRUCHIO
       21  Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
       22  Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
       23  I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
       24  come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.
    Pedant
       25  Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
       26  looking out at the window.
    VINCENTIO
       27  Art thou his father?
    Pedant
       28  Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
    PETRUCHIO
       29  [To VINCENTIO] Why, how now, gentleman! why, this
       30  is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.
    Pedant
       31  Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
       32  cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
  Direction: Re-enter BIONDELLO
    BIONDELLO
       33  I have seen them in the church together: God send
       34  'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
       35  master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.
    VINCENTIO
       36  [Seeing BIONDELLO]
       37  Come hither, crack-hemp.
    BIONDELLO
       38  Hope I may choose, sir.
    VINCENTIO
       39  Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
    BIONDELLO
       40  Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
       41  never saw you before in all my life.
    VINCENTIO
       42  What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
       43  thy master's father, Vincentio?
    BIONDELLO
       44  What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
       45  see where he looks out of the window.
    VINCENTIO
       46  Is't so, indeed.
  Direction: Beats BIONDELLO
    BIONDELLO
       47  Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.
  Direction: Exit
    Pedant
       48  Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
  Direction: Exit from above
    PETRUCHIO
       49  Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
       50  this controversy.
  Direction: They retire
  Direction: Re-enter Pedant below; TRANIO, BAPTISTA, and Servants
    TRANIO
       51  Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
    VINCENTIO
       52  What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
       53  gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
       54  hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
       55  am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
       56  husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
       57  the university.
    TRANIO
       58  How now! what's the matter?
    BAPTISTA
       59  What, is the man lunatic?
    TRANIO
       60  Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
       61  habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
       62  what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
       63  thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.
    VINCENTIO
       64  Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
    BAPTISTA
       65  You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
       66  you think is his name?
    VINCENTIO
       67  His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
       68  him up ever since he was three years old, and his
       69  name is Tranio.
    Pedant
       70  Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
       71  mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
    VINCENTIO
       72  Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
       73  on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
       74  son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
    TRANIO
       75  Call forth an officer.
  Direction: Enter one with an Officer
       76  Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
       77  I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
    VINCENTIO
       78  Carry me to the gaol!
    GREMIO
       79  Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.
    BAPTISTA
       80  Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
    GREMIO
       81  Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
       82  cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
       83  is the right Vincentio.
    Pedant
       84  Swear, if thou darest.
    GREMIO
       85  Nay, I dare not swear it.
    TRANIO
       86  Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
    GREMIO
       87  Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
    BAPTISTA
       88  Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
    VINCENTIO
       89  Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
       90  monstrous villain!
  Direction: Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA
    BIONDELLO
       91  O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
       92  forswear him, or else we are all undone.
    LUCENTIO
       93  [Kneeling] Pardon, sweet father.
    VINCENTIO
       94  Lives my sweet son?
  Direction: Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and Pedant, as fast as may be
    BIANCA
       95  Pardon, dear father.
    BAPTISTA
       96  How hast thou offended?
       97  Where is Lucentio?
    LUCENTIO
       98  Here's Lucentio,
       99  Right son to the right Vincentio;
      100  That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
      101  While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
    GREMIO
      102  Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!
    VINCENTIO
      103  Where is that damned villain Tranio,
      104  That faced and braved me in this matter so?
    BAPTISTA
      105  Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
    BIANCA
      106  Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
    LUCENTIO
      107  Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
      108  Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
      109  While he did bear my countenance in the town;
      110  And happily I have arrived at the last
      111  Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
      112  What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
      113  Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
    VINCENTIO
      114  I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
      115  me to the gaol.
    BAPTISTA
      116  But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
      117  without asking my good will?
    VINCENTIO
      118  Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
      119  I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
  Direction: Exit
    BAPTISTA
      120  And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
  Direction: Exit
    LUCENTIO
      121  Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
  Direction: Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
    GREMIO
      122  My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
      123  Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
  Direction: Exit
    KATHARINA
      124  Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.
    PETRUCHIO
      125  First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
    KATHARINA
      126  What, in the midst of the street?
    PETRUCHIO
      127  What, art thou ashamed of me?
    KATHARINA
      128  No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.
    PETRUCHIO
      129  Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
    KATHARINA
      130  Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
    PETRUCHIO
      131  Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
      132  Better once than never, for never too late.
  Direction: Exeunt
