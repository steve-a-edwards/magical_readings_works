          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 4 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
  Direction: Enter TRANIO, and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO
    TRANIO
        1  Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?
    Pedant
        2  Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
        3  Signior Baptista may remember me,
        4  Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
        5  Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
    TRANIO
        6  'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
        7  With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
    Pedant
        8  I warrant you.
  Direction: Enter BIONDELLO
        9  But, sir, here comes your boy;
       10  'Twere good he were school'd.
    TRANIO
       11  Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
       12  Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
       13  Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
    BIONDELLO
       14  Tut, fear not me.
    TRANIO
       15  But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
    BIONDELLO
       16  I told him that your father was at Venice,
       17  And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
    TRANIO
       18  Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
       19  Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.
  Direction: Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO
       20  Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
  Direction: To the Pedant
       21  Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
       22  I pray you stand good father to me now,
       23  Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
    Pedant
       24  Soft son!
       25  Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
       26  To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
       27  Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
       28  Of love between your daughter and himself:
       29  And, for the good report I hear of you
       30  And for the love he beareth to your daughter
       31  And she to him, to stay him not too long,
       32  I am content, in a good father's care,
       33  To have him match'd; and if you please to like
       34  No worse than I, upon some agreement
       35  Me shall you find ready and willing
       36  With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
       37  For curious I cannot be with you,
       38  Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
    BAPTISTA
       39  Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
       40  Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
       41  Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
       42  Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
       43  Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
       44  And therefore, if you say no more than this,
       45  That like a father you will deal with him
       46  And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
       47  The match is made, and all is done:
       48  Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
    TRANIO
       49  I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
       50  We be affied and such assurance ta'en
       51  As shall with either part's agreement stand?
    BAPTISTA
       52  Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
       53  Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
       54  Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
       55  And happily we might be interrupted.
    TRANIO
       56  Then at my lodging, an it like you:
       57  There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
       58  We'll pass the business privately and well.
       59  Send for your daughter by your servant here:
       60  My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
       61  The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
       62  You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
    BAPTISTA
       63  It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
       64  And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
       65  And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
       66  Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
       67  And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
    BIONDELLO
       68  I pray the gods she may with all my heart!
    TRANIO
       69  Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
  Direction: Exit BIONDELLO
       70  Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
       71  Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
       72  Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
    BAPTISTA
       73  I follow you.
  Direction: Exeunt TRANIO, Pedant, and BAPTISTA
  Direction: Re-enter BIONDELLO
    BIONDELLO
       74  Cambio!
    LUCENTIO
       75  What sayest thou, Biondello?
    BIONDELLO
       76  You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
    LUCENTIO
       77  Biondello, what of that?
    BIONDELLO
       78  Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to
       79  expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
    LUCENTIO
       80  I pray thee, moralize them.
    BIONDELLO
       81  Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
       82  deceiving father of a deceitful son.
    LUCENTIO
       83  And what of him?
    BIONDELLO
       84  His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
    LUCENTIO
       85  And then?
    BIONDELLO
       86  The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
       87  command at all hours.
    LUCENTIO
       88  And what of all this?
    BIONDELLO
       89  I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
       90  counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
       91  'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
       92  church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
       93  honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
       94  I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
       95  ever and a day.
    LUCENTIO
       96  Hearest thou, Biondello?
    BIONDELLO
       97  I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
       98  afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
       99  stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
      100  sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
      101  Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
      102  you come with your appendix.
  Direction: Exit
    LUCENTIO
      103  I may, and will, if she be so contented:
      104  She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
      105  Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
      106  It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.
  Direction: Exit
