          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 5 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Padua. LUCENTIO'S house.
  Direction: Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the Pedant, LUCENTIO, BIANCA, PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO the Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet
    LUCENTIO
        1  At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
        2  And time it is, when raging war is done,
        3  To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
        4  My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
        5  While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
        6  Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
        7  And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
        8  Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
        9  My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
       10  After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
       11  For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
    PETRUCHIO
       12  Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
    BAPTISTA
       13  Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
    PETRUCHIO
       14  Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
    HORTENSIO
       15  For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
    PETRUCHIO
       16  Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
    Widow
       17  Then never trust me, if I be afeard.
    PETRUCHIO
       18  You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
       19  I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
    Widow
       20  He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
    PETRUCHIO
       21  Roundly replied.
    KATHARINA
       22  Mistress, how mean you that?
    Widow
       23  Thus I conceive by him.
    PETRUCHIO
       24  Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
    HORTENSIO
       25  My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.
    PETRUCHIO
       26  Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
    KATHARINA
       27  'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
       28  I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
    Widow
       29  Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
       30  Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
       31  And now you know my meaning,
    KATHARINA
       32  A very mean meaning.
    Widow
       33  Right, I mean you.
    KATHARINA
       34  And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
    PETRUCHIO
       35  To her, Kate!
    HORTENSIO
       36  To her, widow!
    PETRUCHIO
       37  A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
    HORTENSIO
       38  That's my office.
    PETRUCHIO
       39  Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!
  Direction: Drinks to HORTENSIO
    BAPTISTA
       40  How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
    GREMIO
       41  Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
    BIANCA
       42  Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
       43  Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
    VINCENTIO
       44  Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?
    BIANCA
       45  Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
    PETRUCHIO
       46  Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
       47  Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
    BIANCA
       48  Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
       49  And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
       50  You are welcome all.
  Direction: Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow
    PETRUCHIO
       51  She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
       52  This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
       53  Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
    TRANIO
       54  O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
       55  Which runs himself and catches for his master.
    PETRUCHIO
       56  A good swift simile, but something currish.
    TRANIO
       57  'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
       58  'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
    BAPTISTA
       59  O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
    LUCENTIO
       60  I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
    HORTENSIO
       61  Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
    PETRUCHIO
       62  A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
       63  And, as the jest did glance away from me,
       64  'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
    BAPTISTA
       65  Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
       66  I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
    PETRUCHIO
       67  Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
       68  Let's each one send unto his wife;
       69  And he whose wife is most obedient
       70  To come at first when he doth send for her,
       71  Shall win the wager which we will propose.
    HORTENSIO
       72  Content. What is the wager?
    LUCENTIO
       73  Twenty crowns.
    PETRUCHIO
       74  Twenty crowns!
       75  I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
       76  But twenty times so much upon my wife.
    LUCENTIO
       77  A hundred then.
    HORTENSIO
       78  Content.
    PETRUCHIO
       79  A match! 'tis done.
    HORTENSIO
       80  Who shall begin?
    LUCENTIO
       81  That will I.
       82  Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
    BIONDELLO
       83  I go.
  Direction: Exit
    BAPTISTA
       84  Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.
    LUCENTIO
       85  I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
  Direction: Re-enter BIONDELLO
       86  How now! what news?
    BIONDELLO
       87  Sir, my mistress sends you word
       88  That she is busy and she cannot come.
    PETRUCHIO
       89  How! she is busy and she cannot come!
       90  Is that an answer?
    GREMIO
       91  Ay, and a kind one too:
       92  Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
    PETRUCHIO
       93  I hope better.
    HORTENSIO
       94  Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
       95  To come to me forthwith.
  Direction: Exit BIONDELLO
    PETRUCHIO
       96  O, ho! entreat her!
       97  Nay, then she must needs come.
    HORTENSIO
       98  I am afraid, sir,
       99  Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
  Direction: Re-enter BIONDELLO
      100  Now, where's my wife?
    BIONDELLO
      101  She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
      102  She will not come: she bids you come to her.
    PETRUCHIO
      103  Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
      104  Intolerable, not to be endured!
      105  Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
      106  Say, I command her to come to me.
  Direction: Exit GRUMIO
    HORTENSIO
      107  I know her answer.
    PETRUCHIO
      108  What?
    HORTENSIO
      109  She will not.
    PETRUCHIO
      110  The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
    BAPTISTA
      111  Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!
  Direction: Re-enter KATARINA
    KATHARINA
      112  What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
    PETRUCHIO
      113  Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
    KATHARINA
      114  They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
    PETRUCHIO
      115  Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
      116  Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
      117  Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
  Direction: Exit KATHARINA
    LUCENTIO
      118  Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
    HORTENSIO
      119  And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
    PETRUCHIO
      120  Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
      121  And awful rule and right supremacy;
      122  And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?
    BAPTISTA
      123  Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
      124  The wager thou hast won; and I will add
      125  Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
      126  Another dowry to another daughter,
      127  For she is changed, as she had never been.
    PETRUCHIO
      128  Nay, I will win my wager better yet
      129  And show more sign of her obedience,
      130  Her new-built virtue and obedience.
      131  See where she comes and brings your froward wives
      132  As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
  Direction: Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow
      133  Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
      134  Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.
    Widow
      135  Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
      136  Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
    BIANCA
      137  Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
    LUCENTIO
      138  I would your duty were as foolish too:
      139  The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
      140  Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
    BIANCA
      141  The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
    PETRUCHIO
      142  Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
      143  What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
    Widow
      144  Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.
    PETRUCHIO
      145  Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
    Widow
      146  She shall not.
    PETRUCHIO
      147  I say she shall: and first begin with her.
    KATHARINA
      148  Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
      149  And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
      150  To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
      151  It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
      152  Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
      153  And in no sense is meet or amiable.
      154  A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
      155  Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
      156  And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
      157  Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
      158  Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
      159  Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
      160  And for thy maintenance commits his body
      161  To painful labour both by sea and land,
      162  To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
      163  Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
      164  And craves no other tribute at thy hands
      165  But love, fair looks and true obedience;
      166  Too little payment for so great a debt.
      167  Such duty as the subject owes the prince
      168  Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
      169  And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
      170  And not obedient to his honest will,
      171  What is she but a foul contending rebel
      172  And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
      173  I am ashamed that women are so simple
      174  To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
      175  Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
      176  When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
      177  Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
      178  Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
      179  But that our soft conditions and our hearts
      180  Should well agree with our external parts?
      181  Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
      182  My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
      183  My heart as great, my reason haply more,
      184  To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
      185  But now I see our lances are but straws,
      186  Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
      187  That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
      188  Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
      189  And place your hands below your husband's foot:
      190  In token of which duty, if he please,
      191  My hand is ready; may it do him ease.
    PETRUCHIO
      192  Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
    LUCENTIO
      193  Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.
    VINCENTIO
      194  'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
    LUCENTIO
      195  But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
    PETRUCHIO
      196  Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
      197  We three are married, but you two are sped.
  Direction: To LUCENTIO
      198  'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
      199  And, being a winner, God give you good night!
  Direction: Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
    HORTENSIO
      200  Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
    LUCENTIO
      201  'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
  Direction: Exeunt
