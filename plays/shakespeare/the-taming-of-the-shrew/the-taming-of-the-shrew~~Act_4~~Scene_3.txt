          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 4 : Scene 3

SCENE III. A room in PETRUCHIO'S house.
  Direction: Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO
    GRUMIO
        1  No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
    KATHARINA
        2  The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
        3  What, did he marry me to famish me?
        4  Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
        5  Upon entreaty have a present aims;
        6  If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
        7  But I, who never knew how to entreat,
        8  Nor never needed that I should entreat,
        9  Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
       10  With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
       11  And that which spites me more than all these wants,
       12  He does it under name of perfect love;
       13  As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
       14  'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
       15  I prithee go and get me some repast;
       16  I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
    GRUMIO
       17  What say you to a neat's foot?
    KATHARINA
       18  'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.
    GRUMIO
       19  I fear it is too choleric a meat.
       20  How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
    KATHARINA
       21  I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.
    GRUMIO
       22  I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
       23  What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
    KATHARINA
       24  A dish that I do love to feed upon.
    GRUMIO
       25  Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
    KATHARINA
       26  Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.
    GRUMIO
       27  Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
       28  Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
    KATHARINA
       29  Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.
    GRUMIO
       30  Why then, the mustard without the beef.
    KATHARINA
       31  Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
  Direction: Beats him
       32  That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
       33  Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
       34  That triumph thus upon my misery!
       35  Go, get thee gone, I say.
  Direction: Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat
    PETRUCHIO
       36  How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
    HORTENSIO
       37  Mistress, what cheer?
    KATHARINA
       38  Faith, as cold as can be.
    PETRUCHIO
       39  Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
       40  Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
       41  To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
       42  I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
       43  What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;
       44  And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
       45  Here, take away this dish.
    KATHARINA
       46  I pray you, let it stand.
    PETRUCHIO
       47  The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
       48  And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
    KATHARINA
       49  I thank you, sir.
    HORTENSIO
       50  Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
       51  Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
    PETRUCHIO
       52  [Aside] Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.
       53  Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
       54  Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,
       55  Will we return unto thy father's house
       56  And revel it as bravely as the best,
       57  With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
       58  With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;
       59  With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,
       60  With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.
       61  What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,
       62  To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
  Direction: Enter Tailor
       63  Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
       64  Lay forth the gown.
  Direction: Enter Haberdasher
       65  What news with you, sir?
    Haberdasher
       66  Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
    PETRUCHIO
       67  Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
       68  A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
       69  Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
       70  A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
       71  Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
    KATHARINA
       72  I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
       73  And gentlewomen wear such caps as these
    PETRUCHIO
       74  When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
       75  And not till then.
    HORTENSIO
       76  [Aside] That will not be in haste.
    KATHARINA
       77  Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
       78  And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
       79  Your betters have endured me say my mind,
       80  And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
       81  My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
       82  Or else my heart concealing it will break,
       83  And rather than it shall, I will be free
       84  Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
    PETRUCHIO
       85  Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
       86  A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
       87  I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.
    KATHARINA
       88  Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
       89  And it I will have, or I will have none.
  Direction: Exit Haberdasher
    PETRUCHIO
       90  Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
       91  O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
       92  What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
       93  What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
       94  Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
       95  Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
       96  Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
    HORTENSIO
       97  [Aside] I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
    Tailor
       98  You bid me make it orderly and well,
       99  According to the fashion and the time.
    PETRUCHIO
      100  Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
      101  I did not bid you mar it to the time.
      102  Go, hop me over every kennel home,
      103  For you shall hop without my custom, sir:
      104  I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
    KATHARINA
      105  I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
      106  More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
      107  Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
    PETRUCHIO
      108  Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
    Tailor
      109  She says your worship means to make
      110  a puppet of her.
    PETRUCHIO
      111  O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
      112  thou thimble,
      113  Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
      114  Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
      115  Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
      116  Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
      117  Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
      118  As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
      119  I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
    Tailor
      120  Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
      121  Just as my master had direction:
      122  Grumio gave order how it should be done.
    GRUMIO
      123  I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
    Tailor
      124  But how did you desire it should be made?
    GRUMIO
      125  Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
    Tailor
      126  But did you not request to have it cut?
    GRUMIO
      127  Thou hast faced many things.
    Tailor
      128  I have.
    GRUMIO
      129  Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
      130  me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto
      131  thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did
      132  not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.
    Tailor
      133  Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify
    PETRUCHIO
      134  Read it.
    GRUMIO
      135  The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
    Tailor
      136  [Reads] 'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'
    GRUMIO
      137  Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
      138  the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
      139  of brown thread: I said a gown.
    PETRUCHIO
      140  Proceed.
    Tailor
      141  [Reads] 'With a small compassed cape:'
    GRUMIO
      142  I confess the cape.
    Tailor
      143  [Reads] 'With a trunk sleeve:'
    GRUMIO
      144  I confess two sleeves.
    Tailor
      145  [Reads] 'The sleeves curiously cut.'
    PETRUCHIO
      146  Ay, there's the villany.
    GRUMIO
      147  Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
      148  I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
      149  sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,
      150  though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
    Tailor
      151  This is true that I say: an I had thee
      152  in place where, thou shouldst know it.
    GRUMIO
      153  I am for thee straight: take thou the
      154  bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.
    HORTENSIO
      155  God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.
    PETRUCHIO
      156  Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
    GRUMIO
      157  You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.
    PETRUCHIO
      158  Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
    GRUMIO
      159  Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
      160  gown for thy master's use!
    PETRUCHIO
      161  Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
    GRUMIO
      162  O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
      163  Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
      164  O, fie, fie, fie!
    PETRUCHIO
      165  [Aside] Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
      166  Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.
    HORTENSIO
      167  Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:
      168  Take no unkindness of his hasty words:
      169  Away! I say; commend me to thy master.
  Direction: Exit Tailor
    PETRUCHIO
      170  Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
      171  Even in these honest mean habiliments:
      172  Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
      173  For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
      174  And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
      175  So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
      176  What is the jay more precious than the lark,
      177  Because his fathers are more beautiful?
      178  Or is the adder better than the eel,
      179  Because his painted skin contents the eye?
      180  O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
      181  For this poor furniture and mean array.
      182  if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;
      183  And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
      184  To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
      185  Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
      186  And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
      187  There will we mount, and thither walk on foot
      188  Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
      189  And well we may come there by dinner-time.
    KATHARINA
      190  I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
      191  And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
    PETRUCHIO
      192  It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
      193  Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
      194  You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
      195  I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
      196  It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
    HORTENSIO
      197  [Aside] Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
  Direction: Exeunt
