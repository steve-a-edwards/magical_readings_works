          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Padua. A public place.
  Direction: Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO
    LUCENTIO
        1  Tranio, since for the great desire I had
        2  To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
        3  I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
        4  The pleasant garden of great Italy;
        5  And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
        6  With his good will and thy good company,
        7  My trusty servant, well approved in all,
        8  Here let us breathe and haply institute
        9  A course of learning and ingenious studies.
       10  Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
       11  Gave me my being and my father first,
       12  A merchant of great traffic through the world,
       13  Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
       14  Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
       15  It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
       16  To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
       17  And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
       18  Virtue and that part of philosophy
       19  Will I apply that treats of happiness
       20  By virtue specially to be achieved.
       21  Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
       22  And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
       23  A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
       24  And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
    TRANIO
       25  Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
       26  I am in all affected as yourself;
       27  Glad that you thus continue your resolve
       28  To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
       29  Only, good master, while we do admire
       30  This virtue and this moral discipline,
       31  Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
       32  Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
       33  As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
       34  Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
       35  And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
       36  Music and poesy use to quicken you;
       37  The mathematics and the metaphysics,
       38  Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
       39  No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
       40  In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
    LUCENTIO
       41  Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
       42  If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
       43  We could at once put us in readiness,
       44  And take a lodging fit to entertain
       45  Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
       46  But stay a while: what company is this?
    TRANIO
       47  Master, some show to welcome us to town.
  Direction: Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by
    BAPTISTA
       48  Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
       49  For how I firmly am resolved you know;
       50  That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
       51  Before I have a husband for the elder:
       52  If either of you both love Katharina,
       53  Because I know you well and love you well,
       54  Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
    GREMIO
       55  [Aside] To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.
       56  There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?
    KATHARINA
       57  I pray you, sir, is it your will
       58  To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
    HORTENSIO
       59  Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
       60  Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
    KATHARINA
       61  I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
       62  I wis it is not half way to her heart;
       63  But if it were, doubt not her care should be
       64  To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
       65  And paint your face and use you like a fool.
    HORTENSIA
       66  From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
    GREMIO
       67  And me too, good Lord!
    TRANIO
       68  Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:
       69  That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
    LUCENTIO
       70  But in the other's silence do I see
       71  Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
       72  Peace, Tranio!
    TRANIO
       73  Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
    BAPTISTA
       74  Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
       75  What I have said, Bianca, get you in:
       76  And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
       77  For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
    KATHARINA
       78  A pretty peat! it is best
       79  Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
    BIANCA
       80  Sister, content you in my discontent.
       81  Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
       82  My books and instruments shall be my company,
       83  On them to took and practise by myself.
    LUCENTIO
       84  Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.
    HORTENSIO
       85  Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
       86  Sorry am I that our good will effects
       87  Bianca's grief.
    GREMIO
       88  Why will you mew her up,
       89  Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
       90  And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
    BAPTISTA
       91  Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:
       92  Go in, Bianca:
  Direction: Exit BIANCA
       93  And for I know she taketh most delight
       94  In music, instruments and poetry,
       95  Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
       96  Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
       97  Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
       98  Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
       99  I will be very kind, and liberal
      100  To mine own children in good bringing up:
      101  And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
      102  For I have more to commune with Bianca.
  Direction: Exit
    KATHARINA
      103  Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
      104  shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I
      105  knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?
  Direction: Exit
    GREMIO
      106  You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
      107  good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not
      108  so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
      109  together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
      110  both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
      111  sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
      112  man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
      113  wish him to her father.
    HORTENSIO
      114  So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
      115  Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
      116  parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
      117  that we may yet again have access to our fair
      118  mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
      119  labour and effect one thing specially.
    GREMIO
      120  What's that, I pray?
    HORTENSIO
      121  Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
    GREMIO
      122  A husband! a devil.
    HORTENSIO
      123  I say, a husband.
    GREMIO
      124  I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
      125  her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool
      126  to be married to hell?
    HORTENSIO
      127  Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine
      128  to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
      129  fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,
      130  would take her with all faults, and money enough.
    GREMIO
      131  I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
      132  this condition, to be whipped at the high cross
      133  every morning.
    HORTENSIO
      134  Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
      135  apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
      136  friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
      137  maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
      138  to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
      139  and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
      140  be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
      141  How say you, Signior Gremio?
    GREMIO
      142  I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
      143  horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
      144  thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
      145  house of her! Come on.
  Direction: Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO
    TRANIO
      146  I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
      147  That love should of a sudden take such hold?
    LUCENTIO
      148  O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
      149  I never thought it possible or likely;
      150  But see, while idly I stood looking on,
      151  I found the effect of love in idleness:
      152  And now in plainness do confess to thee,
      153  That art to me as secret and as dear
      154  As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
      155  Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
      156  If I achieve not this young modest girl.
      157  Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
      158  Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
    TRANIO
      159  Master, it is no time to chide you now;
      160  Affection is not rated from the heart:
      161  If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
      162  'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
    LUCENTIO
      163  Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
      164  The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
    TRANIO
      165  Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
      166  Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
    LUCENTIO
      167  O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
      168  Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
      169  That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
      170  When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
    TRANIO
      171  Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
      172  Began to scold and raise up such a storm
      173  That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
    LUCENTIO
      174  Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
      175  And with her breath she did perfume the air:
      176  Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
    TRANIO
      177  Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
      178  I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
      179  Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
      180  Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
      181  That till the father rid his hands of her,
      182  Master, your love must live a maid at home;
      183  And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
      184  Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
    LUCENTIO
      185  Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
      186  But art thou not advised, he took some care
      187  To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
    TRANIO
      188  Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.
    LUCENTIO
      189  I have it, Tranio.
    TRANIO
      190  Master, for my hand,
      191  Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
    LUCENTIO
      192  Tell me thine first.
    TRANIO
      193  You will be schoolmaster
      194  And undertake the teaching of the maid:
      195  That's your device.
    LUCENTIO
      196  It is: may it be done?
    TRANIO
      197  Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
      198  And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
      199  Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
      200  Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
    LUCENTIO
      201  Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
      202  We have not yet been seen in any house,
      203  Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
      204  For man or master; then it follows thus;
      205  Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
      206  Keep house and port and servants as I should:
      207  I will some other be, some Florentine,
      208  Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
      209  'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
      210  Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
      211  When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
      212  But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
    TRANIO
      213  So had you need.
      214  In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
      215  And I am tied to be obedient;
      216  For so your father charged me at our parting,
      217  'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
      218  Although I think 'twas in another sense;
      219  I am content to be Lucentio,
      220  Because so well I love Lucentio.
    LUCENTIO
      221  Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
      222  And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
      223  Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
      224  Here comes the rogue.
  Direction: Enter BIONDELLO
      225  Sirrah, where have you been?
    BIONDELLO
      226  Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
      227  Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
      228  you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?
    LUCENTIO
      229  Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
      230  And therefore frame your manners to the time.
      231  Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
      232  Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
      233  And I for my escape have put on his;
      234  For in a quarrel since I came ashore
      235  I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
      236  Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
      237  While I make way from hence to save my life:
      238  You understand me?
    BIONDELLO
      239  I, sir! ne'er a whit.
    LUCENTIO
      240  And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
      241  Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
    BIONDELLO
      242  The better for him: would I were so too!
    TRANIO
      243  So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
      244  That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
      245  But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
      246  You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
      247  When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
      248  But in all places else your master Lucentio.
    LUCENTIO
      249  Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that
      250  thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if
      251  thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good
      252  and weighty.
  Direction: Exeunt
  Direction: The presenters above speak
    First Servant
      253  My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
    SLY
      254  Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:
      255  comes there any more of it?
    Page
      256  My lord, 'tis but begun.
    SLY
      257  'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:
      258  would 'twere done!
  Direction: They sit and mark
