          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. PETRUCHIO'S country house.
  Direction: Enter GRUMIO
    GRUMIO
        1  Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
        2  all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
        3  man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
        4  before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
        5  warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
        6  hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
        7  tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
        8  belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
        9  I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
       10  considering the weather, a taller man than I will
       11  take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.
  Direction: Enter CURTIS
    CURTIS
       12  Who is that calls so coldly?
    GRUMIO
       13  A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
       14  from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
       15  but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.
    CURTIS
       16  Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
    GRUMIO
       17  O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
       18  on no water.
    CURTIS
       19  Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
    GRUMIO
       20  She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
       21  knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it
       22  hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
       23  myself, fellow Curtis.
    CURTIS
       24  Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
    GRUMIO
       25  Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
       26  so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
       27  fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
       28  whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
       29  feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?
    CURTIS
       30  I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
    GRUMIO
       31  A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
       32  therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
       33  my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
    CURTIS
       34  There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.
    GRUMIO
       35  Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
       36  will thaw.
    CURTIS
       37  Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
    GRUMIO
       38  Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
       39  Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
       40  trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
       41  serving-men in their new fustian, their white
       42  stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
       43  Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
       44  the carpets laid, and every thing in order?
    CURTIS
       45  All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
    GRUMIO
       46  First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
       47  mistress fallen out.
    CURTIS
       48  How?
    GRUMIO
       49  Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
       50  hangs a tale.
    CURTIS
       51  Let's ha't, good Grumio.
    GRUMIO
       52  Lend thine ear.
    CURTIS
       53  Here.
    GRUMIO
       54  There.
  Direction: Strikes him
    CURTIS
       55  This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
    GRUMIO
       56  And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
       57  cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
       58  listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
       59  foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--
    CURTIS
       60  Both of one horse?
    GRUMIO
       61  What's that to thee?
    CURTIS
       62  Why, a horse.
    GRUMIO
       63  Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
       64  thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
       65  under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
       66  miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
       67  with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
       68  her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
       69  to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
       70  that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
       71  horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
       72  lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
       73  which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
       74  unexperienced to thy grave.
    CURTIS
       75  By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
    GRUMIO
       76  Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
       77  find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
       78  Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
       79  Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
       80  sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
       81  garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
       82  with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
       83  of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
       84  hands. Are they all ready?
    CURTIS
       85  They are.
    GRUMIO
       86  Call them forth.
    CURTIS
       87  Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
       88  countenance my mistress.
    GRUMIO
       89  Why, she hath a face of her own.
    CURTIS
       90  Who knows not that?
    GRUMIO
       91  Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
       92  countenance her.
    CURTIS
       93  I call them forth to credit her.
    GRUMIO
       94  Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
  Direction: Enter four or five Serving-men
    NATHANIEL
       95  Welcome home, Grumio!
    PHILIP
       96  How now, Grumio!
    JOSEPH
       97  What, Grumio!
    NICHOLAS
       98  Fellow Grumio!
    NATHANIEL
       99  How now, old lad?
    GRUMIO
      100  Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
      101  you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
      102  companions, is all ready, and all things neat?
    NATHANIEL
      103  All things is ready. How near is our master?
    GRUMIO
      104  E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
      105  not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
  Direction: Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
    PETRUCHIO
      106  Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
      107  To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
      108  Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
      109  ALL SERVING-MEN Here, here, sir; here, sir.
    PETRUCHIO
      110  Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
      111  You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
      112  What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
      113  Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
    GRUMIO
      114  Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
    PETRUCHIO
      115  You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
      116  Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
      117  And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
    GRUMIO
      118  Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
      119  And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;
      120  There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
      121  And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
      122  There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
      123  The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
      124  Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
    PETRUCHIO
      125  Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
  Direction: Exeunt Servants
  Direction: Singing
      126  Where is the life that late I led--
      127  Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
      128  Sound, sound, sound, sound!
  Direction: Re-enter Servants with supper
      129  Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
      130  Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
  Direction: Sings
      131  It was the friar of orders grey,
      132  As he forth walked on his way:--
      133  Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
      134  Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
  Direction: Strikes him
      135  Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
      136  Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
      137  And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
      138  One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
      139  Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
  Direction: Enter one with water
      140  Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
      141  You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
  Direction: Strikes him
    KATHARINA
      142  Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
    PETRUCHIO
      143  A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
      144  Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
      145  Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
      146  What's this? mutton?
    First Servant
      147  Ay.
    PETRUCHIO
      148  Who brought it?
    PETER
      149  I.
    PETRUCHIO
      150  'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
      151  What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
      152  How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
      153  And serve it thus to me that love it not?
      154  Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
  Direction: Throws the meat, etc,. about the stage
      155  You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
      156  What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
    KATHARINA
      157  I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
      158  The meat was well, if you were so contented.
    PETRUCHIO
      159  I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
      160  And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
      161  For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
      162  And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
      163  Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
      164  Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
      165  Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
      166  And, for this night, we'll fast for company:
      167  Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
  Direction: Exeunt
  Direction: Re-enter Servants severally
    NATHANIEL
      168  Peter, didst ever see the like?
    PETER
      169  He kills her in her own humour.
  Direction: Re-enter CURTIS
    GRUMIO
      170  Where is he?
    CURTIS
      171  In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
      172  And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
      173  Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
      174  And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
      175  Away, away! for he is coming hither.
  Direction: Exeunt
  Direction: Re-enter PETRUCHIO
    PETRUCHIO
      176  Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
      177  And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
      178  My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
      179  And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
      180  For then she never looks upon her lure.
      181  Another way I have to man my haggard,
      182  To make her come and know her keeper's call,
      183  That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
      184  That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
      185  She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
      186  Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
      187  As with the meat, some undeserved fault
      188  I'll find about the making of the bed;
      189  And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
      190  This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
      191  Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
      192  That all is done in reverend care of her;
      193  And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
      194  And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
      195  And with the clamour keep her still awake.
      196  This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
      197  And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
      198  He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
      199  Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.
  Direction: Exit
