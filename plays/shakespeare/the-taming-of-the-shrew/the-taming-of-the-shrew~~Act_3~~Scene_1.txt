          The Taming Of The Shrew : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Padua. BAPTISTA'S house.
  Direction: Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA
    LUCENTIO
        1  Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
        2  Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
        3  Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
    HORTENSIO
        4  But, wrangling pedant, this is
        5  The patroness of heavenly harmony:
        6  Then give me leave to have prerogative;
        7  And when in music we have spent an hour,
        8  Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
    LUCENTIO
        9  Preposterous ass, that never read so far
       10  To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
       11  Was it not to refresh the mind of man
       12  After his studies or his usual pain?
       13  Then give me leave to read philosophy,
       14  And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
    HORTENSIO
       15  Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
    BIANCA
       16  Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
       17  To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
       18  I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
       19  I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
       20  But learn my lessons as I please myself.
       21  And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
       22  Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
       23  His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
    HORTENSIO
       24  You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
    LUCENTIO
       25  That will be never: tune your instrument.
    BIANCA
       26  Where left we last?
    LUCENTIO
       27  Here, madam:
       28  'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
       29  Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
    BIANCA
       30  Construe them.
    LUCENTIO
       31  'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
       32  Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
       33  'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
       34  'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
       35  a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
       36  bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
       37  beguile the old pantaloon.
    HORTENSIO
       38  Madam, my instrument's in tune.
    BIANCA
       39  Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
    LUCENTIO
       40  Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
    BIANCA
       41  Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
       42  Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
       43  trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
       44  he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
       45  despair not.
    HORTENSIO
       46  Madam, 'tis now in tune.
    LUCENTIO
       47  All but the base.
    HORTENSIO
       48  The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
  Direction: Aside
       49  How fiery and forward our pedant is!
       50  Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
       51  Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
    BIANCA
       52  In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
    LUCENTIO
       53  Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
       54  Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
    BIANCA
       55  I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
       56  I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
       57  But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
       58  Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
       59  That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
    HORTENSIO
       60  You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
       61  My lessons make no music in three parts.
    LUCENTIO
       62  Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
  Direction: Aside
       63  And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
       64  Our fine musician groweth amorous.
    HORTENSIO
       65  Madam, before you touch the instrument,
       66  To learn the order of my fingering,
       67  I must begin with rudiments of art;
       68  To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
       69  More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
       70  Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
       71  And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.
    BIANCA
       72  Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
    HORTENSIO
       73  Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
    BIANCA
       74  [Reads] ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,
       75  'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion;
       76  'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,
       77  'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:
       78  'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:
       79  'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'
       80  Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:
       81  Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,
       82  To change true rules for old inventions.
  Direction: Enter a Servant
    Servant
       83  Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
       84  And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
       85  You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
    BIANCA
       86  Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.
  Direction: Exeunt BIANCA and Servant
    LUCENTIO
       87  Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
  Direction: Exit
    HORTENSIO
       88  But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
       89  Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
       90  Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
       91  To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
       92  Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
       93  Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.
  Direction: Exit
