          King Lear : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. King Lear's palace.
  Direction: Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND
    KENT
        1  I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
        2  Albany than Cornwall.
    GLOUCESTER
        3  It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
        4  division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
        5  the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
        6  weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
        7  of either's moiety.
    KENT
        8  Is not this your son, my lord?
    GLOUCESTER
        9  His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
       10  so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
       11  brazed to it.
    KENT
       12  I cannot conceive you.
    GLOUCESTER
       13  Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
       14  she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
       15  for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
       16  Do you smell a fault?
    KENT
       17  I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
       18  being so proper.
    GLOUCESTER
       19  But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
       20  elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
       21  though this knave came something saucily into the
       22  world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
       23  fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
       24  whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
       25  noble gentleman, Edmund?
    EDMUND
       26  No, my lord.
    GLOUCESTER
       27  My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
       28  honourable friend.
    EDMUND
       29  My services to your lordship.
    KENT
       30  I must love you, and sue to know you better.
    EDMUND
       31  Sir, I shall study deserving.
    GLOUCESTER
       32  He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
       33  again. The king is coming.
  Direction: Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants
    KING LEAR
       34  Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
    GLOUCESTER
       35  I shall, my liege.
  Direction: Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
    KING LEAR
       36  Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
       37  Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
       38  In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
       39  To shake all cares and business from our age;
       40  Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
       41  Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
       42  And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
       43  We have this hour a constant will to publish
       44  Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
       45  May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
       46  Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
       47  Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
       48  And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
       49  Since now we will divest us both of rule,
       50  Interest of territory, cares of state,--
       51  Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
       52  That we our largest bounty may extend
       53  Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
       54  Our eldest-born, speak first.
    GONERIL
       55  Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
       56  Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
       57  Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
       58  No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
       59  As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
       60  A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
       61  Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
    CORDELIA
       62  [Aside] What shall Cordelia do?
       63  Love, and be silent.
    LEAR
       64  Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
       65  With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
       66  With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
       67  We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
       68  Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
       69  Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
    REGAN
       70  Sir, I am made
       71  Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
       72  And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
       73  I find she names my very deed of love;
       74  Only she comes too short: that I profess
       75  Myself an enemy to all other joys,
       76  Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
       77  And find I am alone felicitate
       78  In your dear highness' love.
    CORDELIA
       79  [Aside] Then poor Cordelia!
       80  And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
       81  More richer than my tongue.
    KING LEAR
       82  To thee and thine hereditary ever
       83  Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
       84  No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
       85  Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
       86  Although the last, not least; to whose young love
       87  The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
       88  Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
       89  A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
    CORDELIA
       90  Nothing, my lord.
    KING LEAR
       91  Nothing!
    CORDELIA
       92  Nothing.
    KING LEAR
       93  Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
    CORDELIA
       94  Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
       95  My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
       96  According to my bond; nor more nor less.
    KING LEAR
       97  How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
       98  Lest it may mar your fortunes.
    CORDELIA
       99  Good my lord,
      100  You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
      101  Return those duties back as are right fit,
      102  Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
      103  Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
      104  They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
      105  That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
      106  Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
      107  Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
      108  To love my father all.
    KING LEAR
      109  But goes thy heart with this?
    CORDELIA
      110  Ay, good my lord.
    KING LEAR
      111  So young, and so untender?
    CORDELIA
      112  So young, my lord, and true.
    KING LEAR
      113  Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
      114  For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
      115  The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
      116  By all the operation of the orbs
      117  From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
      118  Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
      119  Propinquity and property of blood,
      120  And as a stranger to my heart and me
      121  Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
      122  Or he that makes his generation messes
      123  To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
      124  Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
      125  As thou my sometime daughter.
    KENT
      126  Good my liege,--
    KING LEAR
      127  Peace, Kent!
      128  Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
      129  I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
      130  On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
      131  So be my grave my peace, as here I give
      132  Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
      133  Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
      134  With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
      135  Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
      136  I do invest you jointly with my power,
      137  Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
      138  That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
      139  With reservation of an hundred knights,
      140  By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
      141  Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
      142  The name, and all the additions to a king;
      143  The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
      144  Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
      145  This coronet part betwixt you.
  Direction: Giving the crown
    KENT
      146  Royal Lear,
      147  Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
      148  Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
      149  As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--
    KING LEAR
      150  The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.
    KENT
      151  Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
      152  The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
      153  When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
      154  Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
      155  When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
      156  When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
      157  And, in thy best consideration, cheque
      158  This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
      159  Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
      160  Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
      161  Reverbs no hollowness.
    KING LEAR
      162  Kent, on thy life, no more.
    KENT
      163  My life I never held but as a pawn
      164  To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
      165  Thy safety being the motive.
    KING LEAR
      166  Out of my sight!
    KENT
      167  See better, Lear; and let me still remain
      168  The true blank of thine eye.
    KING LEAR
      169  Now, by Apollo,--
    KENT
      170  Now, by Apollo, king,
      171  Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
    KING LEAR
      172  O, vassal! miscreant!
  Direction: Laying his hand on his sword
    ALBANY
    CORNWALL
      173  Dear sir, forbear.
    KENT
      174  Do:
      175  Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
      176  Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
      177  Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
      178  I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
    KING LEAR
      179  Hear me, recreant!
      180  On thine allegiance, hear me!
      181  Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
      182  Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
      183  To come between our sentence and our power,
      184  Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
      185  Our potency made good, take thy reward.
      186  Five days we do allot thee, for provision
      187  To shield thee from diseases of the world;
      188  And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
      189  Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
      190  Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
      191  The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
      192  This shall not be revoked.
    KENT
      193  Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
      194  Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
  Direction: To CORDELIA
      195  The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
      196  That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
  Direction: To REGAN and GONERIL
      197  And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
      198  That good effects may spring from words of love.
      199  Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
      200  He'll shape his old course in a country new.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants
    GLOUCESTER
      201  Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
    KING LEAR
      202  My lord of Burgundy.
      203  We first address towards you, who with this king
      204  Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
      205  Will you require in present dower with her,
      206  Or cease your quest of love?
    BURGUNDY
      207  Most royal majesty,
      208  I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
      209  Nor will you tender less.
    KING LEAR
      210  Right noble Burgundy,
      211  When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
      212  But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
      213  If aught within that little seeming substance,
      214  Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
      215  And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
      216  She's there, and she is yours.
    BURGUNDY
      217  I know no answer.
    KING LEAR
      218  Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
      219  Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
      220  Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
      221  Take her, or leave her?
    BURGUNDY
      222  Pardon me, royal sir;
      223  Election makes not up on such conditions.
    KING LEAR
      224  Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
      225  I tell you all her wealth.
  Direction: To KING OF FRANCE
      226  For you, great king,
      227  I would not from your love make such a stray,
      228  To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
      229  To avert your liking a more worthier way
      230  Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
      231  Almost to acknowledge hers.
    KING OF FRANCE
      232  This is most strange,
      233  That she, that even but now was your best object,
      234  The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
      235  Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
      236  Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
      237  So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
      238  Must be of such unnatural degree,
      239  That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
      240  Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
      241  Must be a faith that reason without miracle
      242  Could never plant in me.
    CORDELIA
      243  I yet beseech your majesty,--
      244  If for I want that glib and oily art,
      245  To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
      246  I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
      247  It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
      248  No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
      249  That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
      250  But even for want of that for which I am richer,
      251  A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
      252  As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
      253  Hath lost me in your liking.
    KING LEAR
      254  Better thou
      255  Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.
    KING OF FRANCE
      256  Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
      257  Which often leaves the history unspoke
      258  That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
      259  What say you to the lady? Love's not love
      260  When it is mingled with regards that stand
      261  Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
      262  She is herself a dowry.
    BURGUNDY
      263  Royal Lear,
      264  Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
      265  And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
      266  Duchess of Burgundy.
    KING LEAR
      267  Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
    BURGUNDY
      268  I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
      269  That you must lose a husband.
    CORDELIA
      270  Peace be with Burgundy!
      271  Since that respects of fortune are his love,
      272  I shall not be his wife.
    KING OF FRANCE
      273  Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
      274  Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
      275  Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
      276  Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
      277  Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
      278  My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
      279  Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
      280  Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
      281  Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
      282  Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
      283  Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
      284  Thou losest here, a better where to find.
    KING LEAR
      285  Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
      286  Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
      287  That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
      288  Without our grace, our love, our benison.
      289  Come, noble Burgundy.
  Direction: Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA
    KING OF FRANCE
      290  Bid farewell to your sisters.
    CORDELIA
      291  The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
      292  Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
      293  And like a sister am most loath to call
      294  Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
      295  To your professed bosoms I commit him
      296  But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
      297  I would prefer him to a better place.
      298  So, farewell to you both.
    REGAN
      299  Prescribe not us our duties.
    GONERIL
      300  Let your study
      301  Be to content your lord, who hath received you
      302  At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
      303  And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
    CORDELIA
      304  Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
      305  Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
      306  Well may you prosper!
    KING OF FRANCE
      307  Come, my fair Cordelia.
  Direction: Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA
    GONERIL
      308  Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
      309  most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
      310  father will hence to-night.
    REGAN
      311  That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.
    GONERIL
      312  You see how full of changes his age is; the
      313  observation we have made of it hath not been
      314  little: he always loved our sister most; and
      315  with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
      316  appears too grossly.
    REGAN
      317  'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
      318  but slenderly known himself.
    GONERIL
      319  The best and soundest of his time hath been but
      320  rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
      321  not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
      322  condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
      323  that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
    REGAN
      324  Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
      325  him as this of Kent's banishment.
    GONERIL
      326  There is further compliment of leavetaking
      327  between France and him. Pray you, let's hit
      328  together: if our father carry authority with
      329  such dispositions as he bears, this last
      330  surrender of his will but offend us.
    REGAN
      331  We shall further think on't.
    GONERIL
      332  We must do something, and i' the heat.
  Direction: Exeunt
