          King Lear : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Before ALBANY's palace.
  Direction: Enter GONERIL and EDMUND
    GONERIL
        1  Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
        2  Not met us on the way.
  Direction: Enter OSWALD
        3  Now, where's your master'?
    OSWALD
        4  Madam, within; but never man so changed.
        5  I told him of the army that was landed;
        6  He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
        7  His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
        8  And of the loyal service of his son,
        9  When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
       10  And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
       11  What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
       12  What like, offensive.
    GONERIL
       13  [To EDMUND] Then shall you go no further.
       14  It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
       15  That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
       16  Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
       17  May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
       18  Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
       19  I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
       20  Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
       21  Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
       22  If you dare venture in your own behalf,
       23  A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;
  Direction: Giving a favour
       24  Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
       25  Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
       26  Conceive, and fare thee well.
    EDMUND
       27  Yours in the ranks of death.
    GONERIL
       28  My most dear Gloucester!
  Direction: Exit EDMUND
       29  O, the difference of man and man!
       30  To thee a woman's services are due:
       31  My fool usurps my body.
    OSWALD
       32  Madam, here comes my lord.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter ALBANY
    GONERIL
       33  I have been worth the whistle.
    ALBANY
       34  O Goneril!
       35  You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
       36  Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
       37  That nature, which contemns its origin,
       38  Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
       39  She that herself will sliver and disbranch
       40  From her material sap, perforce must wither
       41  And come to deadly use.
    GONERIL
       42  No more; the text is foolish.
    ALBANY
       43  Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
       44  Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
       45  Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
       46  A father, and a gracious aged man,
       47  Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
       48  Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
       49  Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
       50  A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
       51  If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
       52  Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
       53  It will come,
       54  Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
       55  Like monsters of the deep.
    GONERIL
       56  Milk-liver'd man!
       57  That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
       58  Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
       59  Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
       60  Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
       61  Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
       62  France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
       63  With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;
       64  Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
       65  'Alack, why does he so?'
    ALBANY
       66  See thyself, devil!
       67  Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
       68  So horrid as in woman.
    GONERIL
       69  O vain fool!
    ALBANY
       70  Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
       71  Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
       72  To let these hands obey my blood,
       73  They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
       74  Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,
       75  A woman's shape doth shield thee.
    GONERIL
       76  Marry, your manhood now--
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
    ALBANY
       77  What news?
    Messenger
       78  O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:
       79  Slain by his servant, going to put out
       80  The other eye of Gloucester.
    ALBANY
       81  Gloucester's eye!
    Messenger
       82  A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
       83  Opposed against the act, bending his sword
       84  To his great master; who, thereat enraged,
       85  Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
       86  But not without that harmful stroke, which since
       87  Hath pluck'd him after.
    ALBANY
       88  This shows you are above,
       89  You justicers, that these our nether crimes
       90  So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
       91  Lost he his other eye?
    Messenger
       92  Both, both, my lord.
       93  This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
       94  'Tis from your sister.
    GONERIL
       95  [Aside] One way I like this well;
       96  But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
       97  May all the building in my fancy pluck
       98  Upon my hateful life: another way,
       99  The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.
  Direction: Exit
    ALBANY
      100  Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
    Messenger
      101  Come with my lady hither.
    ALBANY
      102  He is not here.
    Messenger
      103  No, my good lord; I met him back again.
    ALBANY
      104  Knows he the wickedness?
    Messenger
      105  Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;
      106  And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
      107  Might have the freer course.
    ALBANY
      108  Gloucester, I live
      109  To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
      110  And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
      111  Tell me what more thou know'st.
  Direction: Exeunt
