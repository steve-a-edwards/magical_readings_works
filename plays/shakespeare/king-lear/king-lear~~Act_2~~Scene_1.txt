          King Lear : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. GLOUCESTER's castle.
  Direction: Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him
    EDMUND
        1  Save thee, Curan.
    CURAN
        2  And you, sir. I have been with your father, and
        3  given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
        4  his duchess will be here with him this night.
    EDMUND
        5  How comes that?
    CURAN
        6  Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;
        7  I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
        8  ear-kissing arguments?
    EDMUND
        9  Not I pray you, what are they?
    CURAN
       10  Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the
       11  Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
    EDMUND
       12  Not a word.
    CURAN
       13  You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.
  Direction: Exit
    EDMUND
       14  The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
       15  This weaves itself perforce into my business.
       16  My father hath set guard to take my brother;
       17  And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
       18  Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
       19  Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!
  Direction: Enter EDGAR
       20  My father watches: O sir, fly this place;
       21  Intelligence is given where you are hid;
       22  You have now the good advantage of the night:
       23  Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
       24  He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,
       25  And Regan with him: have you nothing said
       26  Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
       27  Advise yourself.
    EDGAR
       28  I am sure on't, not a word.
    EDMUND
       29  I hear my father coming: pardon me:
       30  In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
       31  Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
       32  Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
       33  Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.
  Direction: Exit EDGAR
       34  Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.
  Direction: Wounds his arm
       35  Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
       36  Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
       37  Stop, stop! No help?
  Direction: Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches
    GLOUCESTER
       38  Now, Edmund, where's the villain?
    EDMUND
       39  Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
       40  Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
       41  To stand auspicious mistress,--
    GLOUCESTER
       42  But where is he?
    EDMUND
       43  Look, sir, I bleed.
    GLOUCESTER
       44  Where is the villain, Edmund?
    EDMUND
       45  Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--
    GLOUCESTER
       46  Pursue him, ho! Go after.
  Direction: Exeunt some Servants
       47  By no means what?
    EDMUND
       48  Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
       49  But that I told him, the revenging gods
       50  'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
       51  Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
       52  The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
       53  Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
       54  To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
       55  With his prepared sword, he charges home
       56  My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
       57  But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
       58  Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
       59  Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
       60  Full suddenly he fled.
    GLOUCESTER
       61  Let him fly far:
       62  Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
       63  And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
       64  My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
       65  By his authority I will proclaim it,
       66  That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
       67  Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
       68  He that conceals him, death.
    EDMUND
       69  When I dissuaded him from his intent,
       70  And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
       71  I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
       72  'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
       73  If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
       74  Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
       75  Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
       76  As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
       77  My very character,--I'ld turn it all
       78  To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
       79  And thou must make a dullard of the world,
       80  If they not thought the profits of my death
       81  Were very pregnant and potential spurs
       82  To make thee seek it.'
    GLOUCESTER
       83  Strong and fasten'd villain
       84  Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
  Direction: Tucket within
       85  Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
       86  All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
       87  The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
       88  I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
       89  May have the due note of him; and of my land,
       90  Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
       91  To make thee capable.
  Direction: Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants
    CORNWALL
       92  How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
       93  Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.
    REGAN
       94  If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
       95  Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?
    GLOUCESTER
       96  O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
    REGAN
       97  What, did my father's godson seek your life?
       98  He whom my father named? your Edgar?
    GLOUCESTER
       99  O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
    REGAN
      100  Was he not companion with the riotous knights
      101  That tend upon my father?
    GLOUCESTER
      102  I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.
    EDMUND
      103  Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
    REGAN
      104  No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
      105  'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
      106  To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
      107  I have this present evening from my sister
      108  Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
      109  That if they come to sojourn at my house,
      110  I'll not be there.
    CORNWALL
      111  Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
      112  Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
      113  A child-like office.
    EDMUND
      114  'Twas my duty, sir.
    GLOUCESTER
      115  He did bewray his practise; and received
      116  This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.
    CORNWALL
      117  Is he pursued?
    GLOUCESTER
      118  Ay, my good lord.
    CORNWALL
      119  If he be taken, he shall never more
      120  Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
      121  How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
      122  Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
      123  So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
      124  Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
      125  You we first seize on.
    EDMUND
      126  I shall serve you, sir,
      127  Truly, however else.
    GLOUCESTER
      128  For him I thank your grace.
    CORNWALL
      129  You know not why we came to visit you,--
    REGAN
      130  Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:
      131  Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
      132  Wherein we must have use of your advice:
      133  Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
      134  Of differences, which I least thought it fit
      135  To answer from our home; the several messengers
      136  From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
      137  Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
      138  Your needful counsel to our business,
      139  Which craves the instant use.
    GLOUCESTER
      140  I serve you, madam:
      141  Your graces are right welcome.
  Direction: Exeunt
