          King Lear : Act 3 : Scene 7

SCENE VII. Gloucester's castle.
  Direction: Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and Servants
    CORNWALL
        1  Post speedily to my lord your husband; show him
        2  this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek
        3  out the villain Gloucester.
  Direction: Exeunt some of the Servants
    REGAN
        4  Hang him instantly.
    GONERIL
        5  Pluck out his eyes.
    CORNWALL
        6  Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our
        7  sister company: the revenges we are bound to take
        8  upon your traitorous father are not fit for your
        9  beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to
       10  a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
       11  like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent
       12  betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my
       13  lord of Gloucester.
  Direction: Enter OSWALD
       14  How now! where's the king?
    OSWALD
       15  My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
       16  Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
       17  Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
       18  Who, with some other of the lords dependants,
       19  Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast
       20  To have well-armed friends.
    CORNWALL
       21  Get horses for your mistress.
    GONERIL
       22  Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
    CORNWALL
       23  Edmund, farewell.
  Direction: Exeunt GONERIL, EDMUND, and OSWALD
       24  Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
       25  Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.
  Direction: Exeunt other Servants
       26  Though well we may not pass upon his life
       27  Without the form of justice, yet our power
       28  Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
       29  May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?
  Direction: Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three
    REGAN
       30  Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.
    CORNWALL
       31  Bind fast his corky arms.
    GLOUCESTER
       32  What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider
       33  You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.
    CORNWALL
       34  Bind him, I say.
  Direction: Servants bind him
    REGAN
       35  Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
    GLOUCESTER
       36  Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.
    CORNWALL
       37  To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--
  Direction: REGAN plucks his beard
    GLOUCESTER
       38  By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
       39  To pluck me by the beard.
    REGAN
       40  So white, and such a traitor!
    GLOUCESTER
       41  Naughty lady,
       42  These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,
       43  Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:
       44  With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
       45  You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
    CORNWALL
       46  Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
    REGAN
       47  Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.
    CORNWALL
       48  And what confederacy have you with the traitors
       49  Late footed in the kingdom?
    REGAN
       50  To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.
    GLOUCESTER
       51  I have a letter guessingly set down,
       52  Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
       53  And not from one opposed.
    CORNWALL
       54  Cunning.
    REGAN
       55  And false.
    CORNWALL
       56  Where hast thou sent the king?
    GLOUCESTER
       57  To Dover.
    REGAN
       58  Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--
    CORNWALL
       59  Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
    GLOUCESTER
       60  I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.
    REGAN
       61  Wherefore to Dover, sir?
    GLOUCESTER
       62  Because I would not see thy cruel nails
       63  Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
       64  In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
       65  The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
       66  In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,
       67  And quench'd the stelled fires:
       68  Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
       69  If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
       70  Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'
       71  All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
       72  The winged vengeance overtake such children.
    CORNWALL
       73  See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
       74  Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
    GLOUCESTER
       75  He that will think to live till he be old,
       76  Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!
    REGAN
       77  One side will mock another; the other too.
    CORNWALL
       78  If you see vengeance,--
    First Servant
       79  Hold your hand, my lord:
       80  I have served you ever since I was a child;
       81  But better service have I never done you
       82  Than now to bid you hold.
    REGAN
       83  How now, you dog!
    First Servant
       84  If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
       85  I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?
    CORNWALL
       86  My villain!
  Direction: They draw and fight
    First Servant
       87  Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
    REGAN
       88  Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!
  Direction: Takes a sword, and runs at him behind
    First Servant
       89  O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
       90  To see some mischief on him. O!
  Direction: Dies
    CORNWALL
       91  Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
       92  Where is thy lustre now?
    GLOUCESTER
       93  All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
       94  Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
       95  To quit this horrid act.
    REGAN
       96  Out, treacherous villain!
       97  Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
       98  That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
       99  Who is too good to pity thee.
    GLOUCESTER
      100  O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
      101  Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!
    REGAN
      102  Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
      103  His way to Dover.
  Direction: Exit one with GLOUCESTER
      104  How is't, my lord? how look you?
    CORNWALL
      105  I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
      106  Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
      107  Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:
      108  Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.
  Direction: Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN
    Second Servant
      109  I'll never care what wickedness I do,
      110  If this man come to good.
    Third Servant
      111  If she live long,
      112  And in the end meet the old course of death,
      113  Women will all turn monsters.
    Second Servant
      114  Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam
      115  To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
      116  Allows itself to any thing.
    Third Servant
      117  Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
      118  To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!
  Direction: Exeunt severally
