          King Lear : Act 4 : Scene 6

SCENE VI. Fields near Dover.
  Direction: Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant
    GLOUCESTER
        1  When shall we come to the top of that same hill?
    EDGAR
        2  You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.
    GLOUCESTER
        3  Methinks the ground is even.
    EDGAR
        4  Horrible steep.
        5  Hark, do you hear the sea?
    GLOUCESTER
        6  No, truly.
    EDGAR
        7  Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
        8  By your eyes' anguish.
    GLOUCESTER
        9  So may it be, indeed:
       10  Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
       11  In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
    EDGAR
       12  You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
       13  But in my garments.
    GLOUCESTER
       14  Methinks you're better spoken.
    EDGAR
       15  Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful
       16  And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
       17  The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
       18  Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
       19  Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
       20  Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
       21  The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
       22  Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
       23  Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
       24  Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
       25  That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
       26  Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;
       27  Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
       28  Topple down headlong.
    GLOUCESTER
       29  Set me where you stand.
    EDGAR
       30  Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
       31  Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
       32  Would I not leap upright.
    GLOUCESTER
       33  Let go my hand.
       34  Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
       35  Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
       36  Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;
       37  Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
    EDGAR
       38  Now fare you well, good sir.
    GLOUCESTER
       39  With all my heart.
    EDGAR
       40  Why I do trifle thus with his despair
       41  Is done to cure it.
    GLOUCESTER
       42  [Kneeling] O you mighty gods!
       43  This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
       44  Shake patiently my great affliction off:
       45  If I could bear it longer, and not fall
       46  To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
       47  My snuff and loathed part of nature should
       48  Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
       49  Now, fellow, fare thee well.
  Direction: He falls forward
    EDGAR
       50  Gone, sir: farewell.
       51  And yet I know not how conceit may rob
       52  The treasury of life, when life itself
       53  Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
       54  By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
       55  Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!
       56  Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
       57  What are you, sir?
    GLOUCESTER
       58  Away, and let me die.
    EDGAR
       59  Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
       60  So many fathom down precipitating,
       61  Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
       62  Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
       63  Ten masts at each make not the altitude
       64  Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
       65  Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.
    GLOUCESTER
       66  But have I fall'n, or no?
    EDGAR
       67  From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
       68  Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
       69  Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
    GLOUCESTER
       70  Alack, I have no eyes.
       71  Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
       72  To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
       73  When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
       74  And frustrate his proud will.
    EDGAR
       75  Give me your arm:
       76  Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
    GLOUCESTER
       77  Too well, too well.
    EDGAR
       78  This is above all strangeness.
       79  Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
       80  Which parted from you?
    GLOUCESTER
       81  A poor unfortunate beggar.
    EDGAR
       82  As I stood here below, methought his eyes
       83  Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
       84  Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
       85  It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
       86  Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
       87  Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.
    GLOUCESTER
       88  I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
       89  Affliction till it do cry out itself
       90  'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
       91  I took it for a man; often 'twould say
       92  'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.
    EDGAR
       93  Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
  Direction: Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers
       94  The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
       95  His master thus.
    KING LEAR
       96  No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the
       97  king himself.
    EDGAR
       98  O thou side-piercing sight!
    KING LEAR
       99  Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
      100  press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
      101  crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,
      102  look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted
      103  cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
      104  it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
      105  flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!
      106  Give the word.
    EDGAR
      107  Sweet marjoram.
    KING LEAR
      108  Pass.
    GLOUCESTER
      109  I know that voice.
    KING LEAR
      110  Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered
      111  me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
      112  beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
      113  and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
      114  too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
      115  wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
      116  the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
      117  found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are
      118  not men o' their words: they told me I was every
      119  thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
    GLOUCESTER
      120  The trick of that voice I do well remember:
      121  Is 't not the king?
    KING LEAR
      122  Ay, every inch a king:
      123  When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
      124  I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
      125  Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
      126  The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
      127  Does lecher in my sight.
      128  Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
      129  Was kinder to his father than my daughters
      130  Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
      131  To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
      132  Behold yond simpering dame,
      133  Whose face between her forks presages snow;
      134  That minces virtue, and does shake the head
      135  To hear of pleasure's name;
      136  The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
      137  With a more riotous appetite.
      138  Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
      139  Though women all above:
      140  But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
      141  Beneath is all the fiends';
      142  There's hell, there's darkness, there's the
      143  sulphurous pit,
      144  Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,
      145  fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,
      146  good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:
      147  there's money for thee.
    GLOUCESTER
      148  O, let me kiss that hand!
    KING LEAR
      149  Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
    GLOUCESTER
      150  O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
      151  Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
    KING LEAR
      152  I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
      153  at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not
      154  love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the
      155  penning of it.
    GLOUCESTER
      156  Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.
    EDGAR
      157  I would not take this from report; it is,
      158  And my heart breaks at it.
    KING LEAR
      159  Read.
    GLOUCESTER
      160  What, with the case of eyes?
    KING LEAR
      161  O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
      162  head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in
      163  a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how
      164  this world goes.
    GLOUCESTER
      165  I see it feelingly.
    KING LEAR
      166  What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes
      167  with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
      168  justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
      169  thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
      170  is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen
      171  a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
    GLOUCESTER
      172  Ay, sir.
    KING LEAR
      173  And the creature run from the cur? There thou
      174  mightst behold the great image of authority: a
      175  dog's obeyed in office.
      176  Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
      177  Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
      178  Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
      179  For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
      180  Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
      181  Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
      182  And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:
      183  Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
      184  None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:
      185  Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
      186  To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
      187  And like a scurvy politician, seem
      188  To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:
      189  Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.
    EDGAR
      190  O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!
    KING LEAR
      191  If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
      192  I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
      193  Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
      194  Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,
      195  We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.
    GLOUCESTER
      196  Alack, alack the day!
    KING LEAR
      197  When we are born, we cry that we are come
      198  To this great stage of fools: this a good block;
      199  It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
      200  A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;
      201  And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
      202  Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
  Direction: Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants
    Gentleman
      203  O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,
      204  Your most dear daughter--
    KING LEAR
      205  No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
      206  The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
      207  You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
      208  I am cut to the brains.
    Gentleman
      209  You shall have any thing.
    KING LEAR
      210  No seconds? all myself?
      211  Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
      212  To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
      213  Ay, and laying autumn's dust.
    Gentleman
      214  Good sir,--
    KING LEAR
      215  I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!
      216  I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,
      217  My masters, know you that.
    Gentleman
      218  You are a royal one, and we obey you.
    KING LEAR
      219  Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you
      220  shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.
  Direction: Exit running; Attendants follow
    Gentleman
      221  A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
      222  Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,
      223  Who redeems nature from the general curse
      224  Which twain have brought her to.
    EDGAR
      225  Hail, gentle sir.
    Gentleman
      226  Sir, speed you: what's your will?
    EDGAR
      227  Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
    Gentleman
      228  Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,
      229  Which can distinguish sound.
    EDGAR
      230  But, by your favour,
      231  How near's the other army?
    Gentleman
      232  Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
      233  Stands on the hourly thought.
    EDGAR
      234  I thank you, sir: that's all.
    Gentleman
      235  Though that the queen on special cause is here,
      236  Her army is moved on.
    EDGAR
      237  I thank you, sir.
  Direction: Exit Gentleman
    GLOUCESTER
      238  You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:
      239  Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
      240  To die before you please!
    EDGAR
      241  Well pray you, father.
    GLOUCESTER
      242  Now, good sir, what are you?
    EDGAR
      243  A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
      244  Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
      245  Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
      246  I'll lead you to some biding.
    GLOUCESTER
      247  Hearty thanks:
      248  The bounty and the benison of heaven
      249  To boot, and boot!
  Direction: Enter OSWALD
    OSWALD
      250  A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
      251  That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh
      252  To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
      253  Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out
      254  That must destroy thee.
    GLOUCESTER
      255  Now let thy friendly hand
      256  Put strength enough to't.
  Direction: EDGAR interposes
    OSWALD
      257  Wherefore, bold peasant,
      258  Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
      259  Lest that the infection of his fortune take
      260  Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
    EDGAR
      261  Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.
    OSWALD
      262  Let go, slave, or thou diest!
    EDGAR
      263  Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk
      264  pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,
      265  'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.
      266  Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor
      267  ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be
      268  the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.
    OSWALD
      269  Out, dunghill!
    EDGAR
      270  Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor
      271  your foins.
  Direction: They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down
    OSWALD
      272  Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:
      273  If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;
      274  And give the letters which thou find'st about me
      275  To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out
      276  Upon the British party: O, untimely death!
  Direction: Dies
    EDGAR
      277  I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
      278  As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
      279  As badness would desire.
    GLOUCESTER
      280  What, is he dead?
    EDGAR
      281  Sit you down, father; rest you
      282  Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
      283  May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
      284  He had no other death's-man. Let us see:
      285  Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
      286  To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
      287  Their papers, is more lawful.
  Direction: Reads
      288  'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have
      289  many opportunities to cut him off: if your will
      290  want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.
      291  There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:
      292  then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; from
      293  the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply
      294  the place for your labour.
      295  'Your--wife, so I would say--
      296  'Affectionate servant,
      297  'GONERIL.'
      298  O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!
      299  A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
      300  And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,
      301  Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
      302  Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
      303  With this ungracious paper strike the sight
      304  Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well
      305  That of thy death and business I can tell.
    GLOUCESTER
      306  The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
      307  That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
      308  Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
      309  So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
      310  And woes by wrong imaginations lose
      311  The knowledge of themselves.
    EDGAR
      312  Give me your hand:
  Direction: Drum afar off
      313  Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:
      314  Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.
  Direction: Exeunt
