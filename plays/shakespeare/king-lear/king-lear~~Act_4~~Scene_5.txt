          King Lear : Act 4 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.
  Direction: Enter REGAN and OSWALD
    REGAN
        1  But are my brother's powers set forth?
    OSWALD
        2  Ay, madam.
    REGAN
        3  Himself in person there?
    OSWALD
        4  Madam, with much ado:
        5  Your sister is the better soldier.
    REGAN
        6  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
    OSWALD
        7  No, madam.
    REGAN
        8  What might import my sister's letter to him?
    OSWALD
        9  I know not, lady.
    REGAN
       10  'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
       11  It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
       12  To let him live: where he arrives he moves
       13  All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
       14  In pity of his misery, to dispatch
       15  His nighted life: moreover, to descry
       16  The strength o' the enemy.
    OSWALD
       17  I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
    REGAN
       18  Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
       19  The ways are dangerous.
    OSWALD
       20  I may not, madam:
       21  My lady charged my duty in this business.
    REGAN
       22  Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
       23  Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
       24  Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,
       25  Let me unseal the letter.
    OSWALD
       26  Madam, I had rather--
    REGAN
       27  I know your lady does not love her husband;
       28  I am sure of that: and at her late being here
       29  She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
       30  To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
    OSWALD
       31  I, madam?
    REGAN
       32  I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:
       33  Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
       34  My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
       35  And more convenient is he for my hand
       36  Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
       37  If you do find him, pray you, give him this;
       38  And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
       39  I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
       40  So, fare you well.
       41  If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
       42  Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
    OSWALD
       43  Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
       44  What party I do follow.
    REGAN
       45  Fare thee well.
  Direction: Exeunt
