          King Lear : Act 5 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A field between the two camps.
  Direction: Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours, KING LEAR, CORDELIA, and Soldiers, over the stage; and exeunt
  Direction: Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER
    EDGAR
        1  Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
        2  For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
        3  If ever I return to you again,
        4  I'll bring you comfort.
    GLOUCESTER
        5  Grace go with you, sir!
  Direction: Exit EDGAR
  Direction: Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR
    EDGAR
        6  Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
        7  King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
        8  Give me thy hand; come on.
    GLOUCESTER
        9  No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.
    EDGAR
       10  What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
       11  Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
       12  Ripeness is all: come on.
    GLOUCESTER
       13  And that's true too.
  Direction: Exeunt
