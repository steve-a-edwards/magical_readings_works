          King Lear : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Before Gloucester's castle.
  Direction: Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally
    OSWALD
        1  Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?
    KENT
        2  Ay.
    OSWALD
        3  Where may we set our horses?
    KENT
        4  I' the mire.
    OSWALD
        5  Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
    KENT
        6  I love thee not.
    OSWALD
        7  Why, then, I care not for thee.
    KENT
        8  If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee
        9  care for me.
    OSWALD
       10  Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
    KENT
       11  Fellow, I know thee.
    OSWALD
       12  What dost thou know me for?
    KENT
       13  A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
       14  base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
       15  hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
       16  lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
       17  glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
       18  one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
       19  bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
       20  the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
       21  and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
       22  will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
       23  the least syllable of thy addition.
    OSWALD
       24  Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail
       25  on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
    KENT
       26  What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou
       27  knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
       28  thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
       29  rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
       30  shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:
       31  draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.
  Direction: Drawing his sword
    OSWALD
       32  Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
    KENT
       33  Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the
       34  king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the
       35  royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so
       36  carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.
    OSWALD
       37  Help, ho! murder! help!
    KENT
       38  Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat
       39  slave, strike.
  Direction: Beating him
    OSWALD
       40  Help, ho! murder! murder!
  Direction: Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants
    EDMUND
       41  How now! What's the matter?
    KENT
       42  With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll
       43  flesh ye; come on, young master.
    GLOUCESTER
       44  Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?
    CORNWALL
       45  Keep peace, upon your lives:
       46  He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?
    REGAN
       47  The messengers from our sister and the king.
    CORNWALL
       48  What is your difference? speak.
    OSWALD
       49  I am scarce in breath, my lord.
    KENT
       50  No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You
       51  cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a
       52  tailor made thee.
    CORNWALL
       53  Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
    KENT
       54  Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could
       55  not have made him so ill, though he had been but two
       56  hours at the trade.
    CORNWALL
       57  Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?
    OSWALD
       58  This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared
       59  at suit of his gray beard,--
    KENT
       60  Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My
       61  lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this
       62  unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of
       63  a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?
    CORNWALL
       64  Peace, sirrah!
       65  You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
    KENT
       66  Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
    CORNWALL
       67  Why art thou angry?
    KENT
       68  That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
       69  Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
       70  Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
       71  Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
       72  That in the natures of their lords rebel;
       73  Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
       74  Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
       75  With every gale and vary of their masters,
       76  Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
       77  A plague upon your epileptic visage!
       78  Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
       79  Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
       80  I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
    CORNWALL
       81  Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
    GLOUCESTER
       82  How fell you out? say that.
    KENT
       83  No contraries hold more antipathy
       84  Than I and such a knave.
    CORNWALL
       85  Why dost thou call him a knave? What's his offence?
    KENT
       86  His countenance likes me not.
    CORNWALL
       87  No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.
    KENT
       88  Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
       89  I have seen better faces in my time
       90  Than stands on any shoulder that I see
       91  Before me at this instant.
    CORNWALL
       92  This is some fellow,
       93  Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
       94  A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
       95  Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
       96  An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
       97  An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
       98  These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
       99  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
      100  Than twenty silly ducking observants
      101  That stretch their duties nicely.
    KENT
      102  Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
      103  Under the allowance of your great aspect,
      104  Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
      105  On flickering Phoebus' front,--
    CORNWALL
      106  What mean'st by this?
    KENT
      107  To go out of my dialect, which you
      108  discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
      109  flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
      110  accent was a plain knave; which for my part
      111  I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
      112  to entreat me to 't.
    CORNWALL
      113  What was the offence you gave him?
    OSWALD
      114  I never gave him any:
      115  It pleased the king his master very late
      116  To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
      117  When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,
      118  Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
      119  And put upon him such a deal of man,
      120  That worthied him, got praises of the king
      121  For him attempting who was self-subdued;
      122  And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
      123  Drew on me here again.
    KENT
      124  None of these rogues and cowards
      125  But Ajax is their fool.
    CORNWALL
      126  Fetch forth the stocks!
      127  You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
      128  We'll teach you--
    KENT
      129  Sir, I am too old to learn:
      130  Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
      131  On whose employment I was sent to you:
      132  You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
      133  Against the grace and person of my master,
      134  Stocking his messenger.
    CORNWALL
      135  Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
      136  There shall he sit till noon.
    REGAN
      137  Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.
    KENT
      138  Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
      139  You should not use me so.
    REGAN
      140  Sir, being his knave, I will.
    CORNWALL
      141  This is a fellow of the self-same colour
      142  Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!
  Direction: Stocks brought out
    GLOUCESTER
      143  Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
      144  His fault is much, and the good king his master
      145  Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction
      146  Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
      147  For pilferings and most common trespasses
      148  Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
      149  That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,
      150  Should have him thus restrain'd.
    CORNWALL
      151  I'll answer that.
    REGAN
      152  My sister may receive it much more worse,
      153  To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
      154  For following her affairs. Put in his legs.
  Direction: KENT is put in the stocks
      155  Come, my good lord, away.
  Direction: Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT
    GLOUCESTER
      156  I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,
      157  Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
      158  Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.
    KENT
      159  Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;
      160  Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
      161  A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
      162  Give you good morrow!
    GLOUCESTER
      163  The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.
  Direction: Exit
    KENT
      164  Good king, that must approve the common saw,
      165  Thou out of heaven's benediction comest
      166  To the warm sun!
      167  Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
      168  That by thy comfortable beams I may
      169  Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles
      170  But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
      171  Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
      172  Of my obscured course; and shall find time
      173  From this enormous state, seeking to give
      174  Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,
      175  Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
      176  This shameful lodging.
      177  Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!
  Direction: Sleeps
