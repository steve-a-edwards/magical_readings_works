          King Lear : Act 1 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. A hall in the same.
  Direction: Enter KENT, disguised
    KENT
        1  If but as well I other accents borrow,
        2  That can my speech defuse, my good intent
        3  May carry through itself to that full issue
        4  For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
        5  If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
        6  So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,
        7  Shall find thee full of labours.
  Direction: Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and Attendants
    KING LEAR
        8  Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.
  Direction: Exit an Attendant
        9  How now! what art thou?
    KENT
       10  A man, sir.
    KING LEAR
       11  What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?
    KENT
       12  I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve
       13  him truly that will put me in trust: to love him
       14  that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,
       15  and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I
       16  cannot choose; and to eat no fish.
    KING LEAR
       17  What art thou?
    KENT
       18  A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.
    KING LEAR
       19  If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a
       20  king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?
    KENT
       21  Service.
    KING LEAR
       22  Who wouldst thou serve?
    KENT
       23  You.
    KING LEAR
       24  Dost thou know me, fellow?
    KENT
       25  No, sir; but you have that in your countenance
       26  which I would fain call master.
    KING LEAR
       27  What's that?
    KENT
       28  Authority.
    KING LEAR
       29  What services canst thou do?
    KENT
       30  I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious
       31  tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message
       32  bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am
       33  qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.
    KING LEAR
       34  How old art thou?
    KENT
       35  Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor
       36  so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years
       37  on my back forty eight.
    KING LEAR
       38  Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no
       39  worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.
       40  Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?
       41  Go you, and call my fool hither.
  Direction: Exit an Attendant
  Direction: Enter OSWALD
       42  You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?
    OSWALD
       43  So please you,--
  Direction: Exit
    KING LEAR
       44  What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
  Direction: Exit a Knight
       45  Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.
  Direction: Re-enter Knight
       46  How now! where's that mongrel?
    Knight
       47  He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
    KING LEAR
       48  Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.
    Knight
       49  Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would
       50  not.
    KING LEAR
       51  He would not!
    Knight
       52  My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my
       53  judgment, your highness is not entertained with that
       54  ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a
       55  great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
       56  general dependants as in the duke himself also and
       57  your daughter.
    KING LEAR
       58  Ha! sayest thou so?
    Knight
       59  I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;
       60  for my duty cannot be silent when I think your
       61  highness wronged.
    KING LEAR
       62  Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I
       63  have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I
       64  have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity
       65  than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:
       66  I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I
       67  have not seen him this two days.
    Knight
       68  Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the
       69  fool hath much pined away.
    KING LEAR
       70  No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, and
       71  tell my daughter I would speak with her.
  Direction: Exit an Attendant
       72  Go you, call hither my fool.
  Direction: Exit an Attendant
  Direction: Re-enter OSWALD
       73  O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,
       74  sir?
    OSWALD
       75  My lady's father.
    KING LEAR
       76  'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your
       77  whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!
    OSWALD
       78  I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.
    KING LEAR
       79  Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
  Direction: Striking him
    OSWALD
       80  I'll not be struck, my lord.
    KENT
       81  Nor tripped neither, you base football player.
  Direction: Tripping up his heels
    KING LEAR
       82  I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll
       83  love thee.
    KENT
       84  Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:
       85  away, away! if you will measure your lubber's
       86  length again, tarry: but away! go to; have you
       87  wisdom? so.
  Direction: Pushes OSWALD out
    KING LEAR
       88  Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's
       89  earnest of thy service.
  Direction: Giving KENT money
  Direction: Enter Fool
    Fool
       90  Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.
  Direction: Offering KENT his cap
    KING LEAR
       91  How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?
    Fool
       92  Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.
    KENT
       93  Why, fool?
    Fool
       94  Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:
       95  nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,
       96  thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:
       97  why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,
       98  and did the third a blessing against his will; if
       99  thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.
      100  How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!
    KING LEAR
      101  Why, my boy?
    Fool
      102  If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs
      103  myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.
    KING LEAR
      104  Take heed, sirrah; the whip.
    Fool
      105  Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped
      106  out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.
    KING LEAR
      107  A pestilent gall to me!
    Fool
      108  Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.
    KING LEAR
      109  Do.
    Fool
      110  Mark it, nuncle:
      111  Have more than thou showest,
      112  Speak less than thou knowest,
      113  Lend less than thou owest,
      114  Ride more than thou goest,
      115  Learn more than thou trowest,
      116  Set less than thou throwest;
      117  Leave thy drink and thy whore,
      118  And keep in-a-door,
      119  And thou shalt have more
      120  Than two tens to a score.
    KENT
      121  This is nothing, fool.
    Fool
      122  Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you
      123  gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of
      124  nothing, nuncle?
    KING LEAR
      125  Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.
    Fool
      126  [To KENT] Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of
      127  his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.
    KING LEAR
      128  A bitter fool!
    Fool
      129  Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a
      130  bitter fool and a sweet fool?
    KING LEAR
      131  No, lad; teach me.
    Fool
      132  That lord that counsell'd thee
      133  To give away thy land,
      134  Come place him here by me,
      135  Do thou for him stand:
      136  The sweet and bitter fool
      137  Will presently appear;
      138  The one in motley here,
      139  The other found out there.
    KING LEAR
      140  Dost thou call me fool, boy?
    Fool
      141  All thy other titles thou hast given away; that
      142  thou wast born with.
    KENT
      143  This is not altogether fool, my lord.
    Fool
      144  No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if
      145  I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:
      146  and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool
      147  to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,
      148  nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.
    KING LEAR
      149  What two crowns shall they be?
    Fool
      150  Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat
      151  up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou
      152  clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away
      153  both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er
      154  the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
      155  when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak
      156  like myself in this, let him be whipped that first
      157  finds it so.
  Direction: Singing
      158  Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;
      159  For wise men are grown foppish,
      160  They know not how their wits to wear,
      161  Their manners are so apish.
    KING LEAR
      162  When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
    Fool
      163  I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy
      164  daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them
      165  the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,
  Direction: Singing
      166  Then they for sudden joy did weep,
      167  And I for sorrow sung,
      168  That such a king should play bo-peep,
      169  And go the fools among.
      170  Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach
      171  thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.
    KING LEAR
      172  An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.
    Fool
      173  I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:
      174  they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt
      175  have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am
      176  whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
      177  kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be
      178  thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,
      179  and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'
      180  the parings.
  Direction: Enter GONERIL
    KING LEAR
      181  How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?
      182  Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.
    Fool
      183  Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to
      184  care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a
      185  figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,
      186  thou art nothing.
  Direction: To GONERIL
      187  Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face
      188  bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,
      189  He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
      190  Weary of all, shall want some.
  Direction: Pointing to KING LEAR
      191  That's a shealed peascod.
    GONERIL
      192  Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,
      193  But other of your insolent retinue
      194  Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
      195  In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,
      196  I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
      197  To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
      198  By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
      199  That you protect this course, and put it on
      200  By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
      201  Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
      202  Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
      203  Might in their working do you that offence,
      204  Which else were shame, that then necessity
      205  Will call discreet proceeding.
    Fool
      206  For, you trow, nuncle,
      207  The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
      208  That it's had it head bit off by it young.
      209  So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.
    KING LEAR
      210  Are you our daughter?
    GONERIL
      211  Come, sir,
      212  I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
      213  Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
      214  These dispositions, that of late transform you
      215  From what you rightly are.
    Fool
      216  May not an ass know when the cart
      217  draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.
    KING LEAR
      218  Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:
      219  Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
      220  Either his notion weakens, his discernings
      221  Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
      222  Who is it that can tell me who I am?
    Fool
      223  Lear's shadow.
    KING LEAR
      224  I would learn that; for, by the
      225  marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,
      226  I should be false persuaded I had daughters.
    Fool
      227  Which they will make an obedient father.
    KING LEAR
      228  Your name, fair gentlewoman?
    GONERIL
      229  This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour
      230  Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
      231  To understand my purposes aright:
      232  As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
      233  Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
      234  Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
      235  That this our court, infected with their manners,
      236  Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
      237  Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
      238  Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
      239  For instant remedy: be then desired
      240  By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
      241  A little to disquantity your train;
      242  And the remainder, that shall still depend,
      243  To be such men as may besort your age,
      244  And know themselves and you.
    KING LEAR
      245  Darkness and devils!
      246  Saddle my horses; call my train together:
      247  Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
      248  Yet have I left a daughter.
    GONERIL
      249  You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
      250  Make servants of their betters.
  Direction: Enter ALBANY
    KING LEAR
      251  Woe, that too late repents,--
  Direction: To ALBANY
      252  O, sir, are you come?
      253  Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.
      254  Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
      255  More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
      256  Than the sea-monster!
    ALBANY
      257  Pray, sir, be patient.
    KING LEAR
      258  [To GONERIL] Detested kite! thou liest.
      259  My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
      260  That all particulars of duty know,
      261  And in the most exact regard support
      262  The worships of their name. O most small fault,
      263  How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
      264  That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
      265  From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,
      266  And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
      267  Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,
  Direction: Striking his head
      268  And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
    ALBANY
      269  My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
      270  Of what hath moved you.
    KING LEAR
      271  It may be so, my lord.
      272  Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!
      273  Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
      274  To make this creature fruitful!
      275  Into her womb convey sterility!
      276  Dry up in her the organs of increase;
      277  And from her derogate body never spring
      278  A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
      279  Create her child of spleen; that it may live,
      280  And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
      281  Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
      282  With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
      283  Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
      284  To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
      285  How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
      286  To have a thankless child! Away, away!
  Direction: Exit
    ALBANY
      287  Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
    GONERIL
      288  Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
      289  But let his disposition have that scope
      290  That dotage gives it.
  Direction: Re-enter KING LEAR
    KING LEAR
      291  What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
      292  Within a fortnight!
    ALBANY
      293  What's the matter, sir?
    KING LEAR
      294  I'll tell thee:
  Direction: To GONERIL
      295  Life and death! I am ashamed
      296  That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
      297  That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
      298  Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
      299  The untented woundings of a father's curse
      300  Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
      301  Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
      302  And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
      303  To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?
      304  Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,
      305  Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
      306  When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
      307  She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
      308  That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
      309  I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,
      310  I warrant thee.
  Direction: Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and Attendants
    GONERIL
      311  Do you mark that, my lord?
    ALBANY
      312  I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
      313  To the great love I bear you,--
    GONERIL
      314  Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!
  Direction: To the Fool
      315  You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.
    Fool
      316  Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool
      317  with thee.
      318  A fox, when one has caught her,
      319  And such a daughter,
      320  Should sure to the slaughter,
      321  If my cap would buy a halter:
      322  So the fool follows after.
  Direction: Exit
    GONERIL
      323  This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!
      324  'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
      325  At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
      326  Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
      327  He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
      328  And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!
    ALBANY
      329  Well, you may fear too far.
    GONERIL
      330  Safer than trust too far:
      331  Let me still take away the harms I fear,
      332  Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
      333  What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
      334  If she sustain him and his hundred knights
      335  When I have show'd the unfitness,--
  Direction: Re-enter OSWALD
      336  How now, Oswald!
      337  What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
    OSWALD
      338  Yes, madam.
    GONERIL
      339  Take you some company, and away to horse:
      340  Inform her full of my particular fear;
      341  And thereto add such reasons of your own
      342  As may compact it more. Get you gone;
      343  And hasten your return.
  Direction: Exit OSWALD
      344  No, no, my lord,
      345  This milky gentleness and course of yours
      346  Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,
      347  You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
      348  Than praised for harmful mildness.
    ALBANY
      349  How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:
      350  Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
    GONERIL
      351  Nay, then--
    ALBANY
      352  Well, well; the event.
  Direction: Exeunt
