          King Lear : Act 1 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Court before the same.
  Direction: Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool
    KING LEAR
        1  Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
        2  Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
        3  know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
        4  If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.
    KENT
        5  I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered
        6  your letter.
  Direction: Exit
    Fool
        7  If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in
        8  danger of kibes?
    KING LEAR
        9  Ay, boy.
    Fool
       10  Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go
       11  slip-shod.
    KING LEAR
       12  Ha, ha, ha!
    Fool
       13  Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
       14  for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
       15  apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.
    KING LEAR
       16  Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?
    Fool
       17  She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
       18  crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
       19  the middle on's face?
    KING LEAR
       20  No.
    Fool
       21  Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that
       22  what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.
    KING LEAR
       23  I did her wrong--
    Fool
       24  Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
    KING LEAR
       25  No.
    Fool
       26  Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
    KING LEAR
       27  Why?
    Fool
       28  Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
       29  daughters, and leave his horns without a case.
    KING LEAR
       30  I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
       31  horses ready?
    Fool
       32  Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
       33  seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.
    KING LEAR
       34  Because they are not eight?
    Fool
       35  Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.
    KING LEAR
       36  To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
    Fool
       37  If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
       38  for being old before thy time.
    KING LEAR
       39  How's that?
    Fool
       40  Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
       41  been wise.
    KING LEAR
       42  O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven
       43  Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!
  Direction: Enter Gentleman
       44  How now! are the horses ready?
    Gentleman
       45  Ready, my lord.
    KING LEAR
       46  Come, boy.
    Fool
       47  She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
       48  Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.
  Direction: Exeunt
