          King Lear : Act 1 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace.
  Direction: Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward
    GONERIL
        1  Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
    OSWALD
        2  Yes, madam.
    GONERIL
        3  By day and night he wrongs me; every hour
        4  He flashes into one gross crime or other,
        5  That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
        6  His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
        7  On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
        8  I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
        9  If you come slack of former services,
       10  You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.
    OSWALD
       11  He's coming, madam; I hear him.
  Direction: Horns within
    GONERIL
       12  Put on what weary negligence you please,
       13  You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:
       14  If he dislike it, let him to our sister,
       15  Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
       16  Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,
       17  That still would manage those authorities
       18  That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
       19  Old fools are babes again; and must be used
       20  With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.
       21  Remember what I tell you.
    OSWALD
       22  Well, madam.
    GONERIL
       23  And let his knights have colder looks among you;
       24  What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:
       25  I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
       26  That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,
       27  To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.
  Direction: Exeunt
