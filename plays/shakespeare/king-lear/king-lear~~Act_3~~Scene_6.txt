          King Lear : Act 3 : Scene 6

SCENE VI. A chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle.
  Direction: Enter GLOUCESTER, KING LEAR, KENT, Fool, and EDGAR
    GLOUCESTER
        1  Here is better than the open air; take it
        2  thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what
        3  addition I can: I will not be long from you.
    KENT
        4  All the power of his wits have given way to his
        5  impatience: the gods reward your kindness!
  Direction: Exit GLOUCESTER
    EDGAR
        6  Frateretto calls me; and tells me
        7  Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
        8  Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.
    Fool
        9  Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a
       10  gentleman or a yeoman?
    KING LEAR
       11  A king, a king!
    Fool
       12  No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;
       13  for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman
       14  before him.
    KING LEAR
       15  To have a thousand with red burning spits
       16  Come hissing in upon 'em,--
    EDGAR
       17  The foul fiend bites my back.
    Fool
       18  He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a
       19  horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.
    KING LEAR
       20  It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
  Direction: To EDGAR
       21  Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;
  Direction: To the Fool
       22  Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!
    EDGAR
       23  Look, where he stands and glares!
       24  Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
       25  Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--
    Fool
       26  Her boat hath a leak,
       27  And she must not speak
       28  Why she dares not come over to thee.
    EDGAR
       29  The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
       30  nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
       31  white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no
       32  food for thee.
    KENT
       33  How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:
       34  Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
    KING LEAR
       35  I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.
  Direction: To EDGAR
       36  Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;
  Direction: To the Fool
       37  And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
       38  Bench by his side:
  Direction: To KENT
       39  you are o' the commission,
       40  Sit you too.
    EDGAR
       41  Let us deal justly.
       42  Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
       43  Thy sheep be in the corn;
       44  And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,
       45  Thy sheep shall take no harm.
       46  Pur! the cat is gray.
    KING LEAR
       47  Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my
       48  oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the
       49  poor king her father.
    Fool
       50  Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?
    KING LEAR
       51  She cannot deny it.
    Fool
       52  Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.
    KING LEAR
       53  And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
       54  What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
       55  Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!
       56  False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?
    EDGAR
       57  Bless thy five wits!
    KENT
       58  O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,
       59  That thou so oft have boasted to retain?
    EDGAR
       60  [Aside] My tears begin to take his part so much,
       61  They'll mar my counterfeiting.
    KING LEAR
       62  The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and
       63  Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.
    EDGAR
       64  Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
       65  Be thy mouth or black or white,
       66  Tooth that poisons if it bite;
       67  Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,
       68  Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
       69  Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,
       70  Tom will make them weep and wail:
       71  For, with throwing thus my head,
       72  Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
       73  Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and
       74  fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.
    KING LEAR
       75  Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds
       76  about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that
       77  makes these hard hearts?
  Direction: To EDGAR
       78  You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred; only I
       79  do not like the fashion of your garments: you will
       80  say they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.
    KENT
       81  Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
    KING LEAR
       82  Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:
       83  so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' he morning. So, so, so.
    Fool
       84  And I'll go to bed at noon.
  Direction: Re-enter GLOUCESTER
    GLOUCESTER
       85  Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?
    KENT
       86  Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.
    GLOUCESTER
       87  Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;
       88  I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:
       89  There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,
       90  And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
       91  Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:
       92  If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
       93  With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
       94  Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;
       95  And follow me, that will to some provision
       96  Give thee quick conduct.
    KENT
       97  Oppressed nature sleeps:
       98  This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
       99  Which, if convenience will not allow,
      100  Stand in hard cure.
  Direction: To the Fool
      101  Come, help to bear thy master;
      102  Thou must not stay behind.
    GLOUCESTER
      103  Come, come, away.
  Direction: Exeunt all but EDGAR
    EDGAR
      104  When we our betters see bearing our woes,
      105  We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
      106  Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
      107  Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
      108  But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,
      109  When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
      110  How light and portable my pain seems now,
      111  When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
      112  He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
      113  Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
      114  When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
      115  In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
      116  What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!
      117  Lurk, lurk.
  Direction: Exit
