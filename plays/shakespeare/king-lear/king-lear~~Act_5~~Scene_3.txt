          King Lear : Act 5 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The British camp near Dover.
  Direction: Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND, KING LEAR and CORDELIA, prisoners; Captain, Soldiers
    EDMUND
        1  Some officers take them away: good guard,
        2  Until their greater pleasures first be known
        3  That are to censure them.
    CORDELIA
        4  We are not the first
        5  Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
        6  For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
        7  Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
        8  Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
    KING LEAR
        9  No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:
       10  We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
       11  When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
       12  And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
       13  And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
       14  At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
       15  Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
       16  Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
       17  And take upon's the mystery of things,
       18  As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
       19  In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
       20  That ebb and flow by the moon.
    EDMUND
       21  Take them away.
    KING LEAR
       22  Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
       23  The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
       24  He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
       25  And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
       26  The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
       27  Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve
       28  first. Come.
  Direction: Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded
    EDMUND
       29  Come hither, captain; hark.
       30  Take thou this note;
  Direction: Giving a paper
       31  go follow them to prison:
       32  One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
       33  As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
       34  To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men
       35  Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
       36  Does not become a sword: thy great employment
       37  Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,
       38  Or thrive by other means.
    Captain
       39  I'll do 't, my lord.
    EDMUND
       40  About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
       41  Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so
       42  As I have set it down.
    Captain
       43  I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
       44  If it be man's work, I'll do 't.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another Captain, and Soldiers
    ALBANY
       45  Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,
       46  And fortune led you well: you have the captives
       47  That were the opposites of this day's strife:
       48  We do require them of you, so to use them
       49  As we shall find their merits and our safety
       50  May equally determine.
    EDMUND
       51  Sir, I thought it fit
       52  To send the old and miserable king
       53  To some retention and appointed guard;
       54  Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
       55  To pluck the common bosom on his side,
       56  An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
       57  Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
       58  My reason all the same; and they are ready
       59  To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
       60  Where you shall hold your session. At this time
       61  We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
       62  And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
       63  By those that feel their sharpness:
       64  The question of Cordelia and her father
       65  Requires a fitter place.
    ALBANY
       66  Sir, by your patience,
       67  I hold you but a subject of this war,
       68  Not as a brother.
    REGAN
       69  That's as we list to grace him.
       70  Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
       71  Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
       72  Bore the commission of my place and person;
       73  The which immediacy may well stand up,
       74  And call itself your brother.
    GONERIL
       75  Not so hot:
       76  In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
       77  More than in your addition.
    REGAN
       78  In my rights,
       79  By me invested, he compeers the best.
    GONERIL
       80  That were the most, if he should husband you.
    REGAN
       81  Jesters do oft prove prophets.
    GONERIL
       82  Holla, holla!
       83  That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.
    REGAN
       84  Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
       85  From a full-flowing stomach. General,
       86  Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
       87  Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
       88  Witness the world, that I create thee here
       89  My lord and master.
    GONERIL
       90  Mean you to enjoy him?
    ALBANY
       91  The let-alone lies not in your good will.
    EDMUND
       92  Nor in thine, lord.
    ALBANY
       93  Half-blooded fellow, yes.
    REGAN
       94  [To EDMUND] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
    ALBANY
       95  Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
       96  On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
       97  This gilded serpent
  Direction: Pointing to Goneril
       98  For your claim, fair sister,
       99  I bar it in the interest of my wife:
      100  'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
      101  And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
      102  If you will marry, make your loves to me,
      103  My lady is bespoke.
    GONERIL
      104  An interlude!
    ALBANY
      105  Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:
      106  If none appear to prove upon thy head
      107  Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
      108  There is my pledge;
  Direction: Throwing down a glove
      109  I'll prove it on thy heart,
      110  Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
      111  Than I have here proclaim'd thee.
    REGAN
      112  Sick, O, sick!
    GONERIL
      113  [Aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.
    EDMUND
      114  There's my exchange:
  Direction: Throwing down a glove
      115  what in the world he is
      116  That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
      117  Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
      118  On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
      119  My truth and honour firmly.
    ALBANY
      120  A herald, ho!
    EDMUND
      121  A herald, ho, a herald!
    ALBANY
      122  Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
      123  All levied in my name, have in my name
      124  Took their discharge.
    REGAN
      125  My sickness grows upon me.
    ALBANY
      126  She is not well; convey her to my tent.
  Direction: Exit Regan, led
  Direction: Enter a Herald
      127  Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,
      128  And read out this.
    Captain
      129  Sound, trumpet!
  Direction: A trumpet sounds
    Herald
      130  [Reads] 'If any man of quality or degree within
      131  the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,
      132  supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold
      133  traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the
      134  trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'
    EDMUND
      135  Sound!
  Direction: First trumpet
    Herald
      136  Again!
  Direction: Second trumpet
    Herald
      137  Again!
  Direction: Third trumpet
  Direction: Trumpet answers within
  Direction: Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a trumpet before him
    ALBANY
      138  Ask him his purposes, why he appears
      139  Upon this call o' the trumpet.
    Herald
      140  What are you?
      141  Your name, your quality? and why you answer
      142  This present summons?
    EDGAR
      143  Know, my name is lost;
      144  By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
      145  Yet am I noble as the adversary
      146  I come to cope.
    ALBANY
      147  Which is that adversary?
    EDGAR
      148  What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
    EDMUND
      149  Himself: what say'st thou to him?
    EDGAR
      150  Draw thy sword,
      151  That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
      152  Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
      153  Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
      154  My oath, and my profession: I protest,
      155  Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
      156  Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
      157  Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
      158  False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
      159  Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
      160  And, from the extremest upward of thy head
      161  To the descent and dust below thy foot,
      162  A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
      163  This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
      164  To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
      165  Thou liest.
    EDMUND
      166  In wisdom I should ask thy name;
      167  But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
      168  And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
      169  What safe and nicely I might well delay
      170  By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
      171  Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
      172  With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
      173  Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
      174  This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
      175  Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!
  Direction: Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls
    ALBANY
      176  Save him, save him!
    GONERIL
      177  This is practise, Gloucester:
      178  By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
      179  An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
      180  But cozen'd and beguiled.
    ALBANY
      181  Shut your mouth, dame,
      182  Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:
      183  Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
      184  No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.
  Direction: Gives the letter to EDMUND
    GONERIL
      185  Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:
      186  Who can arraign me for't.
    ALBANY
      187  Most monstrous! oh!
      188  Know'st thou this paper?
    GONERIL
      189  Ask me not what I know.
  Direction: Exit
    ALBANY
      190  Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.
    EDMUND
      191  What you have charged me with, that have I done;
      192  And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
      193  'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
      194  That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
      195  I do forgive thee.
    EDGAR
      196  Let's exchange charity.
      197  I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
      198  If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
      199  My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
      200  The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
      201  Make instruments to plague us:
      202  The dark and vicious place where thee he got
      203  Cost him his eyes.
    EDMUND
      204  Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
      205  The wheel is come full circle: I am here.
    ALBANY
      206  Methought thy very gait did prophesy
      207  A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
      208  Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
      209  Did hate thee or thy father!
    EDGAR
      210  Worthy prince, I know't.
    ALBANY
      211  Where have you hid yourself?
      212  How have you known the miseries of your father?
    EDGAR
      213  By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
      214  And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
      215  The bloody proclamation to escape,
      216  That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
      217  That we the pain of death would hourly die
      218  Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
      219  Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
      220  That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
      221  Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
      222  Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
      223  Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
      224  Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
      225  Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
      226  Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
      227  I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
      228  Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
      229  Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
      230  'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
      231  Burst smilingly.
    EDMUND
      232  This speech of yours hath moved me,
      233  And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
      234  You look as you had something more to say.
    ALBANY
      235  If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
      236  For I am almost ready to dissolve,
      237  Hearing of this.
    EDGAR
      238  This would have seem'd a period
      239  To such as love not sorrow; but another,
      240  To amplify too much, would make much more,
      241  And top extremity.
      242  Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
      243  Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
      244  Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
      245  Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
      246  He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
      247  As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
      248  Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
      249  That ever ear received: which in recounting
      250  His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
      251  Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
      252  And there I left him tranced.
    ALBANY
      253  But who was this?
    EDGAR
      254  Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
      255  Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
      256  Improper for a slave.
  Direction: Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife
    Gentleman
      257  Help, help, O, help!
    EDGAR
      258  What kind of help?
    ALBANY
      259  Speak, man.
    EDGAR
      260  What means that bloody knife?
    Gentleman
      261  'Tis hot, it smokes;
      262  It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!
    ALBANY
      263  Who dead? speak, man.
    Gentleman
      264  Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
      265  By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
    EDMUND
      266  I was contracted to them both: all three
      267  Now marry in an instant.
    EDGAR
      268  Here comes Kent.
    ALBANY
      269  Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
      270  This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
      271  Touches us not with pity.
  Direction: Exit Gentleman
  Direction: Enter KENT
      272  O, is this he?
      273  The time will not allow the compliment
      274  Which very manners urges.
    KENT
      275  I am come
      276  To bid my king and master aye good night:
      277  Is he not here?
    ALBANY
      278  Great thing of us forgot!
      279  Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
      280  See'st thou this object, Kent?
  Direction: The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in
    KENT
      281  Alack, why thus?
    EDMUND
      282  Yet Edmund was beloved:
      283  The one the other poison'd for my sake,
      284  And after slew herself.
    ALBANY
      285  Even so. Cover their faces.
    EDMUND
      286  I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
      287  Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
      288  Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
      289  Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
      290  Nay, send in time.
    ALBANY
      291  Run, run, O, run!
    EDGAR
      292  To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
      293  Thy token of reprieve.
    EDMUND
      294  Well thought on: take my sword,
      295  Give it the captain.
    ALBANY
      296  Haste thee, for thy life.
  Direction: Exit EDGAR
    EDMUND
      297  He hath commission from thy wife and me
      298  To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
      299  To lay the blame upon her own despair,
      300  That she fordid herself.
    ALBANY
      301  The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
  Direction: EDMUND is borne off
  Direction: Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms; EDGAR, Captain, and others following
    KING LEAR
      302  Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:
      303  Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
      304  That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
      305  I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
      306  She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
      307  If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
      308  Why, then she lives.
    KENT
      309  Is this the promised end
    EDGAR
      310  Or image of that horror?
    ALBANY
      311  Fall, and cease!
    KING LEAR
      312  This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
      313  It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
      314  That ever I have felt.
    KENT
      315  [Kneeling] O my good master!
    KING LEAR
      316  Prithee, away.
    EDGAR
      317  'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
    KING LEAR
      318  A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
      319  I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
      320  Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
      321  What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
      322  Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
      323  I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
    Captain
      324  'Tis true, my lords, he did.
    KING LEAR
      325  Did I not, fellow?
      326  I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
      327  I would have made them skip: I am old now,
      328  And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
      329  Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
    KENT
      330  If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
      331  One of them we behold.
    KING LEAR
      332  This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
    KENT
      333  The same,
      334  Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?
    KING LEAR
      335  He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
      336  He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.
    KENT
      337  No, my good lord; I am the very man,--
    KING LEAR
      338  I'll see that straight.
    KENT
      339  That, from your first of difference and decay,
      340  Have follow'd your sad steps.
    KING LEAR
      341  You are welcome hither.
    KENT
      342  Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
      343  Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
      344  And desperately are dead.
    KING LEAR
      345  Ay, so I think.
    ALBANY
      346  He knows not what he says: and vain it is
      347  That we present us to him.
    EDGAR
      348  Very bootless.
  Direction: Enter a Captain
    Captain
      349  Edmund is dead, my lord.
    ALBANY
      350  That's but a trifle here.
      351  You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
      352  What comfort to this great decay may come
      353  Shall be applied: for us we will resign,
      354  During the life of this old majesty,
      355  To him our absolute power:
  Direction: To EDGAR and KENT
      356  you, to your rights:
      357  With boot, and such addition as your honours
      358  Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
      359  The wages of their virtue, and all foes
      360  The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!
    KING LEAR
      361  And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
      362  Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
      363  And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
      364  Never, never, never, never, never!
      365  Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
      366  Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
      367  Look there, look there!
  Direction: Dies
    EDGAR
      368  He faints! My lord, my lord!
    KENT
      369  Break, heart; I prithee, break!
    EDGAR
      370  Look up, my lord.
    KENT
      371  Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
      372  That would upon the rack of this tough world
      373  Stretch him out longer.
    EDGAR
      374  He is gone, indeed.
    KENT
      375  The wonder is, he hath endured so long:
      376  He but usurp'd his life.
    ALBANY
      377  Bear them from hence. Our present business
      378  Is general woe.
  Direction: To KENT and EDGAR
      379  Friends of my soul, you twain
      380  Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.
    KENT
      381  I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
      382  My master calls me, I must not say no.
    ALBANY
      383  The weight of this sad time we must obey;
      384  Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
      385  The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
      386  Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
  Direction: Exeunt, with a dead march
