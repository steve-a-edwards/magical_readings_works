          King Lear : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The Earl of Gloucester's castle.
  Direction: Enter EDMUND, with a letter
    EDMUND
        1  Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
        2  My services are bound. Wherefore should I
        3  Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
        4  The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
        5  For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
        6  Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
        7  When my dimensions are as well compact,
        8  My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
        9  As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
       10  With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
       11  Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
       12  More composition and fierce quality
       13  Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
       14  Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
       15  Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
       16  Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
       17  Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
       18  As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
       19  Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
       20  And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
       21  Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:
       22  Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
  Direction: Enter GLOUCESTER
    GLOUCESTER
       23  Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
       24  And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!
       25  Confined to exhibition! All this done
       26  Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?
    EDMUND
       27  So please your lordship, none.
  Direction: Putting up the letter
    GLOUCESTER
       28  Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
    EDMUND
       29  I know no news, my lord.
    GLOUCESTER
       30  What paper were you reading?
    EDMUND
       31  Nothing, my lord.
    GLOUCESTER
       32  No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of
       33  it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath
       34  not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,
       35  if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
    EDMUND
       36  I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
       37  from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;
       38  and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
       39  fit for your o'er-looking.
    GLOUCESTER
       40  Give me the letter, sir.
    EDMUND
       41  I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The
       42  contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.
    GLOUCESTER
       43  Let's see, let's see.
    EDMUND
       44  I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
       45  this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.
    GLOUCESTER
       46  [Reads] 'This policy and reverence of age makes
       47  the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps
       48  our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
       49  them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
       50  in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not
       51  as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
       52  me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
       53  would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
       54  revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
       55  brother, EDGAR.'
       56  Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you
       57  should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!
       58  Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain
       59  to breed it in?--When came this to you? who
       60  brought it?
    EDMUND
       61  It was not brought me, my lord; there's the
       62  cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the
       63  casement of my closet.
    GLOUCESTER
       64  You know the character to be your brother's?
    EDMUND
       65  If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear
       66  it were his; but, in respect of that, I would
       67  fain think it were not.
    GLOUCESTER
       68  It is his.
    EDMUND
       69  It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is
       70  not in the contents.
    GLOUCESTER
       71  Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?
    EDMUND
       72  Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
       73  maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
       74  and fathers declining, the father should be as
       75  ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
    GLOUCESTER
       76  O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
       77  letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,
       78  brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
       79  seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!
       80  Where is he?
    EDMUND
       81  I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
       82  you to suspend your indignation against my
       83  brother till you can derive from him better
       84  testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
       85  course; where, if you violently proceed against
       86  him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
       87  gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
       88  heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
       89  for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
       90  affection to your honour, and to no further
       91  pretence of danger.
    GLOUCESTER
       92  Think you so?
    EDMUND
       93  If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
       94  where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
       95  auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
       96  that without any further delay than this very evening.
    GLOUCESTER
       97  He cannot be such a monster--
    EDMUND
       98  Nor is not, sure.
    GLOUCESTER
       99  To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
      100  loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
      101  out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
      102  business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
      103  myself, to be in a due resolution.
    EDMUND
      104  I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
      105  business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.
    GLOUCESTER
      106  These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
      107  no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
      108  reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
      109  scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
      110  friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
      111  cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
      112  palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son
      113  and father. This villain of mine comes under the
      114  prediction; there's son against father: the king
      115  falls from bias of nature; there's father against
      116  child. We have seen the best of our time:
      117  machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
      118  ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
      119  graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
      120  lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
      121  noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
      122  offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.
  Direction: Exit
    EDMUND
      123  This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
      124  when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
      125  of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our
      126  disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
      127  if we were villains by necessity; fools by
      128  heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
      129  treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
      130  liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
      131  planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
      132  by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
      133  of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
      134  disposition to the charge of a star! My
      135  father compounded with my mother under the
      136  dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa
      137  major; so that it follows, I am rough and
      138  lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,
      139  had the maidenliest star in the firmament
      140  twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--
  Direction: Enter EDGAR
      141  And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
      142  comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a
      143  sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do
      144  portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.
    EDGAR
      145  How now, brother Edmund! what serious
      146  contemplation are you in?
    EDMUND
      147  I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
      148  this other day, what should follow these eclipses.
    EDGAR
      149  Do you busy yourself about that?
    EDMUND
      150  I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed
      151  unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child
      152  and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of
      153  ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
      154  maledictions against king and nobles; needless
      155  diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
      156  of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.
    EDGAR
      157  How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
    EDMUND
      158  Come, come; when saw you my father last?
    EDGAR
      159  Why, the night gone by.
    EDMUND
      160  Spake you with him?
    EDGAR
      161  Ay, two hours together.
    EDMUND
      162  Parted you in good terms? Found you no
      163  displeasure in him by word or countenance?
    EDGAR
      164  None at all.
    EDMUND
      165  Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
      166  him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
      167  till some little time hath qualified the heat of
      168  his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth
      169  in him, that with the mischief of your person it
      170  would scarcely allay.
    EDGAR
      171  Some villain hath done me wrong.
    EDMUND
      172  That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent
      173  forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
      174  slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my
      175  lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to
      176  hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:
      177  if you do stir abroad, go armed.
    EDGAR
      178  Armed, brother!
    EDMUND
      179  Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I
      180  am no honest man if there be any good meaning
      181  towards you: I have told you what I have seen
      182  and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image
      183  and horror of it: pray you, away.
    EDGAR
      184  Shall I hear from you anon?
    EDMUND
      185  I do serve you in this business.
  Direction: Exit EDGAR
      186  A credulous father! and a brother noble,
      187  Whose nature is so far from doing harms,
      188  That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty
      189  My practises ride easy! I see the business.
      190  Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
      191  All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.
  Direction: Exit
