          King Lear : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. The British camp, near Dover.
  Direction: Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN, Gentlemen, and Soldiers.
    EDMUND
        1  Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
        2  Or whether since he is advised by aught
        3  To change the course: he's full of alteration
        4  And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.
  Direction: To a Gentleman, who goes out
    REGAN
        5  Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
    EDMUND
        6  'Tis to be doubted, madam.
    REGAN
        7  Now, sweet lord,
        8  You know the goodness I intend upon you:
        9  Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,
       10  Do you not love my sister?
    EDMUND
       11  In honour'd love.
    REGAN
       12  But have you never found my brother's way
       13  To the forfended place?
    EDMUND
       14  That thought abuses you.
    REGAN
       15  I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
       16  And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.
    EDMUND
       17  No, by mine honour, madam.
    REGAN
       18  I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
       19  Be not familiar with her.
    EDMUND
       20  Fear me not:
       21  She and the duke her husband!
  Direction: Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers
    GONERIL
       22  [Aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
       23  Should loosen him and me.
    ALBANY
       24  Our very loving sister, well be-met.
       25  Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,
       26  With others whom the rigor of our state
       27  Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
       28  I never yet was valiant: for this business,
       29  It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
       30  Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,
       31  Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
    EDMUND
       32  Sir, you speak nobly.
    REGAN
       33  Why is this reason'd?
    GONERIL
       34  Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
       35  For these domestic and particular broils
       36  Are not the question here.
    ALBANY
       37  Let's then determine
       38  With the ancient of war on our proceedings.
    EDMUND
       39  I shall attend you presently at your tent.
    REGAN
       40  Sister, you'll go with us?
    GONERIL
       41  No.
    REGAN
       42  'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.
    GONERIL
       43  [Aside] O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.
  Direction: As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised
    EDGAR
       44  If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
       45  Hear me one word.
    ALBANY
       46  I'll overtake you. Speak.
  Direction: Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR
    EDGAR
       47  Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
       48  If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
       49  For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
       50  I can produce a champion that will prove
       51  What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
       52  Your business of the world hath so an end,
       53  And machination ceases. Fortune love you.
    ALBANY
       54  Stay till I have read the letter.
    EDGAR
       55  I was forbid it.
       56  When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
       57  And I'll appear again.
    ALBANY
       58  Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.
  Direction: Exit EDGAR
  Direction: Re-enter EDMUND
    EDMUND
       59  The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
       60  Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
       61  By diligent discovery; but your haste
       62  Is now urged on you.
    ALBANY
       63  We will greet the time.
  Direction: Exit
    EDMUND
       64  To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
       65  Each jealous of the other, as the stung
       66  Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
       67  Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
       68  If both remain alive: to take the widow
       69  Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
       70  And hardly shall I carry out my side,
       71  Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
       72  His countenance for the battle; which being done,
       73  Let her who would be rid of him devise
       74  His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
       75  Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
       76  The battle done, and they within our power,
       77  Shall never see his pardon; for my state
       78  Stands on me to defend, not to debate.
  Direction: Exit
