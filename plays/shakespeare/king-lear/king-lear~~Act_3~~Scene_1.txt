          King Lear : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A heath.
  Direction: Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting
    KENT
        1  Who's there, besides foul weather?
    Gentleman
        2  One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
    KENT
        3  I know you. Where's the king?
    Gentleman
        4  Contending with the fretful element:
        5  Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
        6  Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,
        7  That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
        8  Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
        9  Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
       10  Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
       11  The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
       12  This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
       13  The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
       14  Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
       15  And bids what will take all.
    KENT
       16  But who is with him?
    Gentleman
       17  None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
       18  His heart-struck injuries.
    KENT
       19  Sir, I do know you;
       20  And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
       21  Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
       22  Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
       23  With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
       24  Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
       25  Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
       26  Which are to France the spies and speculations
       27  Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
       28  Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
       29  Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
       30  Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
       31  Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
       32  But, true it is, from France there comes a power
       33  Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
       34  Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
       35  In some of our best ports, and are at point
       36  To show their open banner. Now to you:
       37  If on my credit you dare build so far
       38  To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
       39  Some that will thank you, making just report
       40  Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
       41  The king hath cause to plain.
       42  I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
       43  And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
       44  This office to you.
    Gentleman
       45  I will talk further with you.
    KENT
       46  No, do not.
       47  For confirmation that I am much more
       48  Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
       49  What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--
       50  As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;
       51  And she will tell you who your fellow is
       52  That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
       53  I will go seek the king.
    Gentleman
       54  Give me your hand: have you no more to say?
    KENT
       55  Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
       56  That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain
       57  That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him
       58  Holla the other.
  Direction: Exeunt severally
