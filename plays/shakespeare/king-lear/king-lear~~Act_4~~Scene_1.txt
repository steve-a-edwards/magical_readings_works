          King Lear : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. The heath.
  Direction: Enter EDGAR
    EDGAR
        1  Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
        2  Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
        3  The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
        4  Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
        5  The lamentable change is from the best;
        6  The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
        7  Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
        8  The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
        9  Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?
  Direction: Enter GLOUCESTER, led by an Old Man
       10  My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
       11  But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
       12  Lie would not yield to age.
    Old Man
       13  O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and
       14  your father's tenant, these fourscore years.
    GLOUCESTER
       15  Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:
       16  Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
       17  Thee they may hurt.
    Old Man
       18  Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.
    GLOUCESTER
       19  I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
       20  I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,
       21  Our means secure us, and our mere defects
       22  Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,
       23  The food of thy abused father's wrath!
       24  Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
       25  I'ld say I had eyes again!
    Old Man
       26  How now! Who's there?
    EDGAR
       27  [Aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at
       28  the worst'?
       29  I am worse than e'er I was.
    Old Man
       30  'Tis poor mad Tom.
    EDGAR
       31  [Aside] And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
       32  So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'
    Old Man
       33  Fellow, where goest?
    GLOUCESTER
       34  Is it a beggar-man?
    Old Man
       35  Madman and beggar too.
    GLOUCESTER
       36  He has some reason, else he could not beg.
       37  I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
       38  Which made me think a man a worm: my son
       39  Came then into my mind; and yet my mind
       40  Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
       41  more since.
       42  As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.
       43  They kill us for their sport.
    EDGAR
       44  [Aside] How should this be?
       45  Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
       46  Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!
    GLOUCESTER
       47  Is that the naked fellow?
    Old Man
       48  Ay, my lord.
    GLOUCESTER
       49  Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,
       50  Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
       51  I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
       52  And bring some covering for this naked soul,
       53  Who I'll entreat to lead me.
    Old Man
       54  Alack, sir, he is mad.
    GLOUCESTER
       55  'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
       56  Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
       57  Above the rest, be gone.
    Old Man
       58  I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
       59  Come on't what will.
  Direction: Exit
    GLOUCESTER
       60  Sirrah, naked fellow,--
    EDGAR
       61  Poor Tom's a-cold.
  Direction: Aside
       62  I cannot daub it further.
    GLOUCESTER
       63  Come hither, fellow.
    EDGAR
       64  [Aside] And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
    GLOUCESTER
       65  Know'st thou the way to Dover?
    EDGAR
       66  Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor
       67  Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
       68  thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five
       69  fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as
       70  Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
       71  stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of
       72  mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
       73  and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!
    GLOUCESTER
       74  Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
       75  Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
       76  Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
       77  Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
       78  That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
       79  Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;
       80  So distribution should undo excess,
       81  And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
    EDGAR
       82  Ay, master.
    GLOUCESTER
       83  There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
       84  Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
       85  Bring me but to the very brim of it,
       86  And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
       87  With something rich about me: from that place
       88  I shall no leading need.
    EDGAR
       89  Give me thy arm:
       90  Poor Tom shall lead thee.
  Direction: Exeunt
