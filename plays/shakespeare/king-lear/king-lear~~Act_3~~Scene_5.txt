          King Lear : Act 3 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.
  Direction: Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND
    CORNWALL
        1  I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
    EDMUND
        2  How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
        3  gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
        4  of.
    CORNWALL
        5  I now perceive, it was not altogether your
        6  brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;
        7  but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
        8  badness in himself.
    EDMUND
        9  How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
       10  be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
       11  approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
       12  of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
       13  or not I the detector!
    CORNWALL
       14  o with me to the duchess.
    EDMUND
       15  If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
       16  mighty business in hand.
    CORNWALL
       17  True or false, it hath made thee earl of
       18  Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
       19  may be ready for our apprehension.
    EDMUND
       20  [Aside] If I find him comforting the king, it will
       21  stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
       22  my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore
       23  between that and my blood.
    CORNWALL
       24  I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a
       25  dearer father in my love.
  Direction: Exeunt
