          King Lear : Act 4 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The French camp near Dover.
  Direction: Enter KENT and a Gentleman
    KENT
        1  Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
        2  know you the reason?
    Gentleman
        3  Something he left imperfect in the
        4  state, which since his coming forth is thought
        5  of; which imports to the kingdom so much
        6  fear and danger, that his personal return was
        7  most required and necessary.
    KENT
        8  Who hath he left behind him general?
    Gentleman
        9  The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
    KENT
       10  Did your letters pierce the queen to any
       11  demonstration of grief?
    Gentleman
       12  Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
       13  And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
       14  Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
       15  Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
       16  Sought to be king o'er her.
    KENT
       17  O, then it moved her.
    Gentleman
       18  Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
       19  Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
       20  Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
       21  Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
       22  That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
       23  What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
       24  As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
       25  Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
       26  If all could so become it.
    KENT
       27  Made she no verbal question?
    Gentleman
       28  'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
       29  Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
       30  Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
       31  Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
       32  Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
       33  The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
       34  And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
       35  To deal with grief alone.
    KENT
       36  It is the stars,
       37  The stars above us, govern our conditions;
       38  Else one self mate and mate could not beget
       39  Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
    Gentleman
       40  No.
    KENT
       41  Was this before the king return'd?
    Gentleman
       42  No, since.
    KENT
       43  Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
       44  Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
       45  What we are come about, and by no means
       46  Will yield to see his daughter.
    Gentleman
       47  Why, good sir?
    KENT
       48  A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
       49  That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
       50  To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
       51  To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
       52  His mind so venomously, that burning shame
       53  Detains him from Cordelia.
    Gentleman
       54  Alack, poor gentleman!
    KENT
       55  Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
    Gentleman
       56  'Tis so, they are afoot.
    KENT
       57  Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
       58  And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
       59  Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
       60  When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
       61  Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
       62  Along with me.
  Direction: Exeunt
