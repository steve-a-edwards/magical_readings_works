          King Lear : Act 2 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.
  Direction: Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman
    KING LEAR
        1  'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
        2  And not send back my messenger.
    Gentleman
        3  As I learn'd,
        4  The night before there was no purpose in them
        5  Of this remove.
    KENT
        6  Hail to thee, noble master!
    KING LEAR
        7  Ha!
        8  Makest thou this shame thy pastime?
    KENT
        9  No, my lord.
    Fool
       10  Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied
       11  by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by
       12  the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's
       13  over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden
       14  nether-stocks.
    KING LEAR
       15  What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
       16  To set thee here?
    KENT
       17  It is both he and she;
       18  Your son and daughter.
    KING LEAR
       19  No.
    KENT
       20  Yes.
    KING LEAR
       21  No, I say.
    KENT
       22  I say, yea.
    KING LEAR
       23  No, no, they would not.
    KENT
       24  Yes, they have.
    KING LEAR
       25  By Jupiter, I swear, no.
    KENT
       26  By Juno, I swear, ay.
    KING LEAR
       27  They durst not do 't;
       28  They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,
       29  To do upon respect such violent outrage:
       30  Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
       31  Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,
       32  Coming from us.
    KENT
       33  My lord, when at their home
       34  I did commend your highness' letters to them,
       35  Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
       36  My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
       37  Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
       38  From Goneril his mistress salutations;
       39  Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
       40  Which presently they read: on whose contents,
       41  They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
       42  Commanded me to follow, and attend
       43  The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
       44  And meeting here the other messenger,
       45  Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--
       46  Being the very fellow that of late
       47  Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
       48  Having more man than wit about me, drew:
       49  He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
       50  Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
       51  The shame which here it suffers.
    Fool
       52  Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.
       53  Fathers that wear rags
       54  Do make their children blind;
       55  But fathers that bear bags
       56  Shall see their children kind.
       57  Fortune, that arrant whore,
       58  Ne'er turns the key to the poor.
       59  But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours
       60  for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
    KING LEAR
       61  O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
       62  Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
       63  Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?
    KENT
       64  With the earl, sir, here within.
    KING LEAR
       65  Follow me not;
       66  Stay here.
  Direction: Exit
    Gentleman
       67  Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
    KENT
       68  None.
       69  How chance the king comes with so small a train?
    Fool
       70  And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that
       71  question, thou hadst well deserved it.
    KENT
       72  Why, fool?
    Fool
       73  We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee
       74  there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow
       75  their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
       76  there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
       77  that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
       78  runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
       79  following it: but the great one that goes up the
       80  hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
       81  gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
       82  would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
       83  That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
       84  And follows but for form,
       85  Will pack when it begins to rain,
       86  And leave thee in the storm,
       87  But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
       88  And let the wise man fly:
       89  The knave turns fool that runs away;
       90  The fool no knave, perdy.
    KENT
       91  Where learned you this, fool?
    Fool
       92  Not i' the stocks, fool.
  Direction: Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER
    KING LEAR
       93  Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
       94  They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;
       95  The images of revolt and flying off.
       96  Fetch me a better answer.
    GLOUCESTER
       97  My dear lord,
       98  You know the fiery quality of the duke;
       99  How unremoveable and fix'd he is
      100  In his own course.
    KING LEAR
      101  Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
      102  Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
      103  I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
    GLOUCESTER
      104  Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
    KING LEAR
      105  Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?
    GLOUCESTER
      106  Ay, my good lord.
    KING LEAR
      107  The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
      108  Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
      109  Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
      110  Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--
      111  No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
      112  Infirmity doth still neglect all office
      113  Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
      114  When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
      115  To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
      116  And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
      117  To take the indisposed and sickly fit
      118  For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore
  Direction: Looking on KENT
      119  Should he sit here? This act persuades me
      120  That this remotion of the duke and her
      121  Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.
      122  Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,
      123  Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
      124  Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
      125  Till it cry sleep to death.
    GLOUCESTER
      126  I would have all well betwixt you.
  Direction: Exit
    KING LEAR
      127  O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!
    Fool
      128  Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels
      129  when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em
      130  o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,
      131  wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure
      132  kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.
  Direction: Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants
    KING LEAR
      133  Good morrow to you both.
    CORNWALL
      134  Hail to your grace!
  Direction: KENT is set at liberty
    REGAN
      135  I am glad to see your highness.
    KING LEAR
      136  Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
      137  I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
      138  I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
      139  Sepulchring an adultress.
  Direction: To KENT
      140  O, are you free?
      141  Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
      142  Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
      143  Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:
  Direction: Points to his heart
      144  I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
      145  With how depraved a quality--O Regan!
    REGAN
      146  I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.
      147  You less know how to value her desert
      148  Than she to scant her duty.
    KING LEAR
      149  Say, how is that?
    REGAN
      150  I cannot think my sister in the least
      151  Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
      152  She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
      153  'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
      154  As clears her from all blame.
    KING LEAR
      155  My curses on her!
    REGAN
      156  O, sir, you are old.
      157  Nature in you stands on the very verge
      158  Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
      159  By some discretion, that discerns your state
      160  Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
      161  That to our sister you do make return;
      162  Say you have wrong'd her, sir.
    KING LEAR
      163  Ask her forgiveness?
      164  Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
      165  'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;
  Direction: Kneeling
      166  Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
      167  That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'
    REGAN
      168  Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
      169  Return you to my sister.
    KING LEAR
      170  [Rising] Never, Regan:
      171  She hath abated me of half my train;
      172  Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
      173  Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
      174  All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
      175  On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
      176  You taking airs, with lameness!
    CORNWALL
      177  Fie, sir, fie!
    KING LEAR
      178  You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
      179  Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
      180  You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
      181  To fall and blast her pride!
    REGAN
      182  O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
      183  When the rash mood is on.
    KING LEAR
      184  No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
      185  Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
      186  Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
      187  Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
      188  To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
      189  To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
      190  And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
      191  Against my coming in: thou better know'st
      192  The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
      193  Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
      194  Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
      195  Wherein I thee endow'd.
    REGAN
      196  Good sir, to the purpose.
    KING LEAR
      197  Who put my man i' the stocks?
  Direction: Tucket within
    CORNWALL
      198  What trumpet's that?
    REGAN
      199  I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,
      200  That she would soon be here.
  Direction: Enter OSWALD
      201  Is your lady come?
    KING LEAR
      202  This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride
      203  Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
      204  Out, varlet, from my sight!
    CORNWALL
      205  What means your grace?
    KING LEAR
      206  Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
      207  Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,
  Direction: Enter GONERIL
      208  If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
      209  Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
      210  Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!
  Direction: To GONERIL
      211  Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
      212  O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
    GONERIL
      213  Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
      214  All's not offence that indiscretion finds
      215  And dotage terms so.
    KING LEAR
      216  O sides, you are too tough;
      217  Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?
    CORNWALL
      218  I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
      219  Deserved much less advancement.
    KING LEAR
      220  You! did you?
    REGAN
      221  I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
      222  If, till the expiration of your month,
      223  You will return and sojourn with my sister,
      224  Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
      225  I am now from home, and out of that provision
      226  Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
    KING LEAR
      227  Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
      228  No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
      229  To wage against the enmity o' the air;
      230  To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
      231  Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
      232  Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
      233  Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
      234  To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg
      235  To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
      236  Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
      237  To this detested groom.
  Direction: Pointing at OSWALD
    GONERIL
      238  At your choice, sir.
    KING LEAR
      239  I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
      240  I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
      241  We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
      242  But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
      243  Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
      244  Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
      245  A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
      246  In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
      247  Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
      248  I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
      249  Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
      250  Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
      251  I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
      252  I and my hundred knights.
    REGAN
      253  Not altogether so:
      254  I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
      255  For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
      256  For those that mingle reason with your passion
      257  Must be content to think you old, and so--
      258  But she knows what she does.
    KING LEAR
      259  Is this well spoken?
    REGAN
      260  I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
      261  Is it not well? What should you need of more?
      262  Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
      263  Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,
      264  Should many people, under two commands,
      265  Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.
    GONERIL
      266  Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
      267  From those that she calls servants or from mine?
    REGAN
      268  Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,
      269  We could control them. If you will come to me,--
      270  For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
      271  To bring but five and twenty: to no more
      272  Will I give place or notice.
    KING LEAR
      273  I gave you all--
    REGAN
      274  And in good time you gave it.
    KING LEAR
      275  Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
      276  But kept a reservation to be follow'd
      277  With such a number. What, must I come to you
      278  With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?
    REGAN
      279  And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.
    KING LEAR
      280  Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
      281  When others are more wicked: not being the worst
      282  Stands in some rank of praise.
  Direction: To GONERIL
      283  I'll go with thee:
      284  Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,
      285  And thou art twice her love.
    GONERIL
      286  Hear me, my lord;
      287  What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
      288  To follow in a house where twice so many
      289  Have a command to tend you?
    REGAN
      290  What need one?
    KING LEAR
      291  O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
      292  Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
      293  Allow not nature more than nature needs,
      294  Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
      295  If only to go warm were gorgeous,
      296  Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
      297  Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
      298  You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
      299  You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
      300  As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
      301  If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
      302  Against their father, fool me not so much
      303  To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
      304  And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
      305  Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
      306  I will have such revenges on you both,
      307  That all the world shall--I will do such things,--
      308  What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be
      309  The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
      310  No, I'll not weep:
      311  I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
      312  Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
      313  Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
  Direction: Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool
  Direction: Storm and tempest
    CORNWALL
      314  Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
    REGAN
      315  This house is little: the old man and his people
      316  Cannot be well bestow'd.
    GONERIL
      317  'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,
      318  And must needs taste his folly.
    REGAN
      319  For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
      320  But not one follower.
    GONERIL
      321  So am I purposed.
      322  Where is my lord of Gloucester?
    CORNWALL
      323  Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.
  Direction: Re-enter GLOUCESTER
    GLOUCESTER
      324  The king is in high rage.
    CORNWALL
      325  Whither is he going?
    GLOUCESTER
      326  He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.
    CORNWALL
      327  'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
    GONERIL
      328  My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
    GLOUCESTER
      329  Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
      330  Do sorely ruffle; for many miles a bout
      331  There's scarce a bush.
    REGAN
      332  O, sir, to wilful men,
      333  The injuries that they themselves procure
      334  Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
      335  He is attended with a desperate train;
