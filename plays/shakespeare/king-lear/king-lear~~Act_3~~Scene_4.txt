          King Lear : Act 3 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. The heath. Before a hovel.
  Direction: Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool
    KENT
        1  Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:
        2  The tyranny of the open night's too rough
        3  For nature to endure.
  Direction: Storm still
    KING LEAR
        4  Let me alone.
    KENT
        5  Good my lord, enter here.
    KING LEAR
        6  Wilt break my heart?
    KENT
        7  I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.
    KING LEAR
        8  Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
        9  Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
       10  But where the greater malady is fix'd,
       11  The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;
       12  But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
       13  Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the
       14  mind's free,
       15  The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
       16  Doth from my senses take all feeling else
       17  Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
       18  Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
       19  For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:
       20  No, I will weep no more. In such a night
       21  To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
       22  In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
       23  Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--
       24  O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
       25  No more of that.
    KENT
       26  Good my lord, enter here.
    KING LEAR
       27  Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:
       28  This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
       29  On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
  Direction: To the Fool
       30  In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--
       31  Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
  Direction: Fool goes in
       32  Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,
       33  That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
       34  How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
       35  Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
       36  From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
       37  Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
       38  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
       39  That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
       40  And show the heavens more just.
    EDGAR
       41  [Within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!
  Direction: The Fool runs out from the hovel
    Fool
       42  Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit
       43  Help me, help me!
    KENT
       44  Give me thy hand. Who's there?
    Fool
       45  A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.
    KENT
       46  What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
       47  Come forth.
  Direction: Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man
    EDGAR
       48  Away! the foul fiend follows me!
       49  Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
       50  Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.
    KING LEAR
       51  Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
       52  And art thou come to this?
    EDGAR
       53  Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul
       54  fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and
       55  through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;
       56  that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters
       57  in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film
       58  proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over
       59  four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a
       60  traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do
       61  de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,
       62  star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
       63  charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I
       64  have him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.
  Direction: Storm still
    KING LEAR
       65  What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
       66  Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?
    Fool
       67  Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.
    KING LEAR
       68  Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air
       69  Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
    KENT
       70  He hath no daughters, sir.
    KING LEAR
       71  Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
       72  To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
       73  Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
       74  Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
       75  Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
       76  Those pelican daughters.
    EDGAR
       77  Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:
       78  Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!
    Fool
       79  This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
    EDGAR
       80  Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;
       81  keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with
       82  man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud
       83  array. Tom's a-cold.
    KING LEAR
       84  What hast thou been?
    EDGAR
       85  A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled
       86  my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of
       87  my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with
       88  her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and
       89  broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
       90  slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:
       91  wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman
       92  out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of
       93  ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,
       94  wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
       95  Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
       96  silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot
       97  out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen
       98  from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
       99  Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:
      100  Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.
      101  Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.
  Direction: Storm still
    KING LEAR
      102  Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer
      103  with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
      104  Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou
      105  owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep
      106  no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on
      107  's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:
      108  unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,
      109  forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!
      110  come unbutton here.
  Direction: Tearing off his clothes
    Fool
      111  Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night
      112  to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were
      113  like an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all the
      114  rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.
  Direction: Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch
    EDGAR
      115  This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins
      116  at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives
      117  the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the
      118  hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the
      119  poor creature of earth.
      120  S. Withold footed thrice the old;
      121  He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;
      122  Bid her alight,
      123  And her troth plight,
      124  And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
    KENT
      125  How fares your grace?
    KING LEAR
      126  What's he?
    KENT
      127  Who's there? What is't you seek?
    GLOUCESTER
      128  What are you there? Your names?
    EDGAR
      129  Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,
      130  the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in
      131  the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,
      132  eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and
      133  the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the
      134  standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to
      135  tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who
      136  hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his
      137  body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;
      138  But mice and rats, and such small deer,
      139  Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
      140  Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!
    GLOUCESTER
      141  What, hath your grace no better company?
    EDGAR
      142  The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
      143  Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.
    GLOUCESTER
      144  Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
      145  That it doth hate what gets it.
    EDGAR
      146  Poor Tom's a-cold.
    GLOUCESTER
      147  Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
      148  To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:
      149  Though their injunction be to bar my doors,
      150  And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
      151  Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,
      152  And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
    KING LEAR
      153  First let me talk with this philosopher.
      154  What is the cause of thunder?
    KENT
      155  Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.
    KING LEAR
      156  I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
      157  What is your study?
    EDGAR
      158  How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.
    KING LEAR
      159  Let me ask you one word in private.
    KENT
      160  Importune him once more to go, my lord;
      161  His wits begin to unsettle.
    GLOUCESTER
      162  Canst thou blame him?
  Direction: Storm still
      163  His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!
      164  He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
      165  Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,
      166  I am almost mad myself: I had a son,
      167  Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,
      168  But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;
      169  No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,
      170  The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!
      171  I do beseech your grace,--
    KING LEAR
      172  O, cry your mercy, sir.
      173  Noble philosopher, your company.
    EDGAR
      174  Tom's a-cold.
    GLOUCESTER
      175  In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.
    KING LEAR
      176  Come let's in all.
    KENT
      177  This way, my lord.
    KING LEAR
      178  With him;
      179  I will keep still with my philosopher.
    KENT
      180  Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.
    GLOUCESTER
      181  Take him you on.
    KENT
      182  Sirrah, come on; go along with us.
    KING LEAR
      183  Come, good Athenian.
    GLOUCESTER
      184  No words, no words: hush.
    EDGAR
      185  Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
      186  His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,
      187  I smell the blood of a British man.
  Direction: Exeunt
