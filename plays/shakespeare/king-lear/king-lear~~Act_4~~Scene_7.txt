          King Lear : Act 4 : Scene 7

SCENE VII. A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep.
  Direction: Enter CORDELIA, KENT disguised, gentleman and Doctor
    CORDELIA
        1  O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
        2  To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
        3  And every measure fail me.
    KENT
        4  To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
        5  All my reports go with the modest truth;
        6  Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.
    CORDELIA
        7  Be better suited:
        8  These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
        9  I prithee, put them off.
    KENT
       10  Pardon me, dear madam;
       11  Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
       12  My boon I make it, that you know me not
       13  Till time and I think meet.
    CORDELIA
       14  Then be't so, my good lord.
  Direction: To the Doctor
       15  How does the king?
    Doctor
       16  Madam, sleeps still.
    CORDELIA
       17  O you kind gods,
       18  Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
       19  The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
       20  Of this child-changed father!
    Doctor
       21  So please your majesty
       22  That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.
    CORDELIA
       23  Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
       24  I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?
    Gentleman
       25  Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep
       26  We put fresh garments on him.
    Doctor
       27  Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
       28  I doubt not of his temperance.
    CORDELIA
       29  Very well.
    Doctor
       30  Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!
    CORDELIA
       31  O my dear father! Restoration hang
       32  Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
       33  Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
       34  Have in thy reverence made!
    KENT
       35  Kind and dear princess!
    CORDELIA
       36  Had you not been their father, these white flakes
       37  Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
       38  To be opposed against the warring winds?
       39  To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
       40  In the most terrible and nimble stroke
       41  Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
       42  With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
       43  Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
       44  Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
       45  To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
       46  In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
       47  'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
       48  Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.
    Doctor
       49  Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
    CORDELIA
       50  How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?
    KING LEAR
       51  You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
       52  Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
       53  Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
       54  Do scald like moulten lead.
    CORDELIA
       55  Sir, do you know me?
    KING LEAR
       56  You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?
    CORDELIA
       57  Still, still, far wide!
    Doctor
       58  He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.
    KING LEAR
       59  Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
       60  I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
       61  To see another thus. I know not what to say.
       62  I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
       63  I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
       64  Of my condition!
    CORDELIA
       65  O, look upon me, sir,
       66  And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
       67  No, sir, you must not kneel.
    KING LEAR
       68  Pray, do not mock me:
       69  I am a very foolish fond old man,
       70  Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
       71  And, to deal plainly,
       72  I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
       73  Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
       74  Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
       75  What place this is; and all the skill I have
       76  Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
       77  Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
       78  For, as I am a man, I think this lady
       79  To be my child Cordelia.
    CORDELIA
       80  And so I am, I am.
    KING LEAR
       81  Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:
       82  If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
       83  I know you do not love me; for your sisters
       84  Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
       85  You have some cause, they have not.
    CORDELIA
       86  No cause, no cause.
    KING LEAR
       87  Am I in France?
    KENT
       88  In your own kingdom, sir.
    KING LEAR
       89  Do not abuse me.
    Doctor
       90  Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
       91  You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
       92  To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
       93  Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
       94  Till further settling.
    CORDELIA
       95  Will't please your highness walk?
    KING LEAR
       96  You must bear with me:
       97  Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
  Direction: Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman
    Gentleman
       98  Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
    KENT
       99  Most certain, sir.
    Gentleman
      100  Who is conductor of his people?
    KENT
      101  As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
    Gentleman
      102  They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl
      103  of Kent in Germany.
    KENT
      104  Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the
      105  powers of the kingdom approach apace.
    Gentleman
      106  The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you
      107  well, sir.
  Direction: Exit
    KENT
      108  My point and period will be throughly wrought,
      109  Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.
  Direction: Exit
