          King Lear : Act 3 : Scene 3

SCENE III. Gloucester's castle.
  Direction: Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
    GLOUCESTER
        1  Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural
        2  dealing. When I desire their leave that I might
        3  pity him, they took from me the use of mine own
        4  house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual
        5  displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for
        6  him, nor any way sustain him.
    EDMUND
        7  Most savage and unnatural!
    GLOUCESTER
        8  Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt
        9  the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have
       10  received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be
       11  spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:
       12  these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
       13  home; there's part of a power already footed: we
       14  must incline to the king. I will seek him, and
       15  privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with
       16  the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:
       17  if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.
       18  Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,
       19  the king my old master must be relieved. There is
       20  some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.
  Direction: Exit
    EDMUND
       21  This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
       22  Instantly know; and of that letter too:
       23  This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
       24  That which my father loses; no less than all:
       25  The younger rises when the old doth fall.
  Direction: Exit
