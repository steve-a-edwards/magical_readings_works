          King Lear : Act 4 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. The same. A tent.
  Direction: Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and Soldiers
    CORDELIA
        1  Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
        2  As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
        3  Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
        4  With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
        5  Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
        6  In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
        7  Search every acre in the high-grown field,
        8  And bring him to our eye.
  Direction: Exit an Officer
        9  What can man's wisdom
       10  In the restoring his bereaved sense?
       11  He that helps him take all my outward worth.
    Doctor
       12  There is means, madam:
       13  Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
       14  The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,
       15  Are many simples operative, whose power
       16  Will close the eye of anguish.
    CORDELIA
       17  All blest secrets,
       18  All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
       19  Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
       20  In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;
       21  Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
       22  That wants the means to lead it.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
    Messenger
       23  News, madam;
       24  The British powers are marching hitherward.
    CORDELIA
       25  'Tis known before; our preparation stands
       26  In expectation of them. O dear father,
       27  It is thy business that I go about;
       28  Therefore great France
       29  My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
       30  No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
       31  But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:
       32  Soon may I hear and see him!
  Direction: Exeunt
