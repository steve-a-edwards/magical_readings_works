          Twelfth Night : Act 1 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
  Direction: Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire
    VALENTINE
        1  If the duke continue these favours towards you,
        2  Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
        3  known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
    VIOLA
        4  You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
        5  you call in question the continuance of his love:
        6  is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
    VALENTINE
        7  No, believe me.
    VIOLA
        8  I thank you. Here comes the count.
  Direction: Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and Attendants
    DUKE ORSINO
        9  Who saw Cesario, ho?
    VIOLA
       10  On your attendance, my lord; here.
    DUKE ORSINO
       11  Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,
       12  Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
       13  To thee the book even of my secret soul:
       14  Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
       15  Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
       16  And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
       17  Till thou have audience.
    VIOLA
       18  Sure, my noble lord,
       19  If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
       20  As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
    DUKE ORSINO
       21  Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
       22  Rather than make unprofited return.
    VIOLA
       23  Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
    DUKE ORSINO
       24  O, then unfold the passion of my love,
       25  Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
       26  It shall become thee well to act my woes;
       27  She will attend it better in thy youth
       28  Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
    VIOLA
       29  I think not so, my lord.
    DUKE ORSINO
       30  Dear lad, believe it;
       31  For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
       32  That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
       33  Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
       34  Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
       35  And all is semblative a woman's part.
       36  I know thy constellation is right apt
       37  For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
       38  All, if you will; for I myself am best
       39  When least in company. Prosper well in this,
       40  And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
       41  To call his fortunes thine.
    VIOLA
       42  I'll do my best
       43  To woo your lady:
  Direction: Aside
       44  yet, a barful strife!
       45  Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
  Direction: Exeunt
