          Twelfth Night : Act 1 : Scene 3

SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.
  Direction: Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
    SIR TOBY BELCH
        1  What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
        2  her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
    MARIA
        3  By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
        4  nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
        5  exceptions to your ill hours.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
        6  Why, let her except, before excepted.
    MARIA
        7  Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
        8  limits of order.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
        9  Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
       10  these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
       11  these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
       12  themselves in their own straps.
    MARIA
       13  That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
       14  my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
       15  knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       16  Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
    MARIA
       17  Ay, he.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       18  He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
    MARIA
       19  What's that to the purpose?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       20  Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
    MARIA
       21  Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:
       22  he's a very fool and a prodigal.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       23  Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
       24  viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
       25  word for word without book, and hath all the good
       26  gifts of nature.
    MARIA
       27  He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that
       28  he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that
       29  he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
       30  hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
       31  he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       32  By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
       33  that say so of him. Who are they?
    MARIA
       34  They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       35  With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
       36  her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
       37  drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
       38  that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
       39  o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
       40  Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
  Direction: Enter SIR ANDREW
    SIR ANDREW
       41  Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       42  Sweet Sir Andrew!
    SIR ANDREW
       43  Bless you, fair shrew.
    MARIA
       44  And you too, sir.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       45  Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
    SIR ANDREW
       46  What's that?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       47  My niece's chambermaid.
    SIR ANDREW
       48  Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
    MARIA
       49  My name is Mary, sir.
    SIR ANDREW
       50  Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       51  You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
       52  her, woo her, assail her.
    SIR ANDREW
       53  By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
       54  company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
    MARIA
       55  Fare you well, gentlemen.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       56  An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
       57  never draw sword again.
    SIR ANDREW
       58  An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
       59  draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
       60  fools in hand?
    MARIA
       61  Sir, I have not you by the hand.
    SIR ANDREW
       62  Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
    MARIA
       63  Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring
       64  your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
    SIR ANDREW
       65  Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?
    MARIA
       66  It's dry, sir.
    SIR ANDREW
       67  Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
       68  keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
    MARIA
       69  A dry jest, sir.
    SIR ANDREW
       70  Are you full of them?
    MARIA
       71  Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,
       72  now I let go your hand, I am barren.
  Direction: Exit
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       73  O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
       74  see thee so put down?
    SIR ANDREW
       75  Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary
       76  put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
       77  than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
       78  great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       79  No question.
    SIR ANDREW
       80  An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
       81  to-morrow, Sir Toby.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       82  Pourquoi, my dear knight?
    SIR ANDREW
       83  What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
       84  bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
       85  fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
       86  followed the arts!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       87  Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
    SIR ANDREW
       88  Why, would that have mended my hair?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       89  Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
    SIR ANDREW
       90  But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       91  Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
       92  hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
       93  and spin it off.
    SIR ANDREW
       94  Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece
       95  will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one
       96  she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       97  She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
       98  her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
       99  have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
      100  man.
    SIR ANDREW
      101  I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
      102  strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
      103  and revels sometimes altogether.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      104  Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
    SIR ANDREW
      105  As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
      106  degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
      107  with an old man.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      108  What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
    SIR ANDREW
      109  Faith, I can cut a caper.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      110  And I can cut the mutton to't.
    SIR ANDREW
      111  And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
      112  as any man in Illyria.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      113  Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
      114  these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
      115  take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
      116  thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
      117  a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
      118  so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
      119  dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
      120  I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
      121  leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
    SIR ANDREW
      122  Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
      123  flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      124  What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
    SIR ANDREW
      125  Taurus! That's sides and heart.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      126  No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the
      127  caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!
  Direction: Exeunt
