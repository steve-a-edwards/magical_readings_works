          Twelfth Night : Act 4 : Scene 3

SCENE III. OLIVIA's garden.
  Direction: Enter SEBASTIAN
    SEBASTIAN
        1  This is the air; that is the glorious sun;
        2  This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;
        3  And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
        4  Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?
        5  I could not find him at the Elephant:
        6  Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,
        7  That he did range the town to seek me out.
        8  His counsel now might do me golden service;
        9  For though my soul disputes well with my sense,
       10  That this may be some error, but no madness,
       11  Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
       12  So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
       13  That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
       14  And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
       15  To any other trust but that I am mad
       16  Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,
       17  She could not sway her house, command her followers,
       18  Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
       19  With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing
       20  As I perceive she does: there's something in't
       21  That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.
  Direction: Enter OLIVIA and Priest
    OLIVIA
       22  Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,
       23  Now go with me and with this holy man
       24  Into the chantry by: there, before him,
       25  And underneath that consecrated roof,
       26  Plight me the full assurance of your faith;
       27  That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
       28  May live at peace. He shall conceal it
       29  Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
       30  What time we will our celebration keep
       31  According to my birth. What do you say?
    SEBASTIAN
       32  I'll follow this good man, and go with you;
       33  And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
    OLIVIA
       34  Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,
       35  That they may fairly note this act of mine!
  Direction: Exeunt
