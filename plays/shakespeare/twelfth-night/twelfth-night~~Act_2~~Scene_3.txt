          Twelfth Night : Act 2 : Scene 3

SCENE III. OLIVIA's house.
  Direction: Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW
    SIR TOBY BELCH
        1  Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after
        2  midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo
        3  surgere,' thou know'st,--
    SIR ANDREW
        4  Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up
        5  late is to be up late.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
        6  A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.
        7  To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is
        8  early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
        9  to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the
       10  four elements?
    SIR ANDREW
       11  Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists
       12  of eating and drinking.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       13  Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.
       14  Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!
  Direction: Enter Clown
    SIR ANDREW
       15  Here comes the fool, i' faith.
    Clown
       16  How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture
       17  of 'we three'?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       18  Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.
    SIR ANDREW
       19  By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I
       20  had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,
       21  and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In
       22  sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last
       23  night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the
       24  Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas
       25  very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy
       26  leman: hadst it?
    Clown
       27  I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose
       28  is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the
       29  Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
    SIR ANDREW
       30  Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all
       31  is done. Now, a song.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       32  Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.
    SIR ANDREW
       33  There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--
    Clown
       34  Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       35  A love-song, a love-song.
    SIR ANDREW
       36  Ay, ay: I care not for good life.
    Clown
       37  [Sings]
       38  O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
       39  O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,
       40  That can sing both high and low:
       41  Trip no further, pretty sweeting;
       42  Journeys end in lovers meeting,
       43  Every wise man's son doth know.
    SIR ANDREW
       44  Excellent good, i' faith.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       45  Good, good.
    Clown
       46  [Sings]
       47  What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
       48  Present mirth hath present laughter;
       49  What's to come is still unsure:
       50  In delay there lies no plenty;
       51  Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,
       52  Youth's a stuff will not endure.
    SIR ANDREW
       53  A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       54  A contagious breath.
    SIR ANDREW
       55  Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       56  To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
       57  But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we
       58  rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three
       59  souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?
    SIR ANDREW
       60  An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.
    Clown
       61  By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
    SIR ANDREW
       62  Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'
    Clown
       63  'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be
       64  constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.
    SIR ANDREW
       65  'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to
       66  call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'
    Clown
       67  I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
    SIR ANDREW
       68  Good, i' faith. Come, begin.
  Direction: Catch sung
  Direction: Enter MARIA
    MARIA
       69  What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady
       70  have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him
       71  turn you out of doors, never trust me.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       72  My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's
       73  a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not
       74  I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?
       75  Tillyvally. Lady!
  Direction: Sings
       76  'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'
    Clown
       77  Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.
    SIR ANDREW
       78  Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do
       79  I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it
       80  more natural.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       81  [Sings] 'O, the twelfth day of December,'--
    MARIA
       82  For the love o' God, peace!
  Direction: Enter MALVOLIO
    MALVOLIO
       83  My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye
       84  no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like
       85  tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an
       86  alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your
       87  coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse
       88  of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
       89  time in you?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       90  We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
    MALVOLIO
       91  Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me
       92  tell you, that, though she harbours you as her
       93  kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If
       94  you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you
       95  are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please
       96  you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid
       97  you farewell.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       98  'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'
    MARIA
       99  Nay, good Sir Toby.
    Clown
      100  'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'
    MALVOLIO
      101  Is't even so?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      102  'But I will never die.'
    Clown
      103  Sir Toby, there you lie.
    MALVOLIO
      104  This is much credit to you.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      105  'Shall I bid him go?'
    Clown
      106  'What an if you do?'
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      107  'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'
    Clown
      108  'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      109  Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a
      110  steward? Dost thou think, because thou art
      111  virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
    Clown
      112  Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the
      113  mouth too.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      114  Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with
      115  crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!
    MALVOLIO
      116  Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any
      117  thing more than contempt, you would not give means
      118  for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.
  Direction: Exit
    MARIA
      119  Go shake your ears.
    SIR ANDREW
      120  'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's
      121  a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to
      122  break promise with him and make a fool of him.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      123  Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll
      124  deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
    MARIA
      125  Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the
      126  youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is
      127  much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me
      128  alone with him: if I do not gull him into a
      129  nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not
      130  think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:
      131  I know I can do it.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      132  Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.
    MARIA
      133  Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
    SIR ANDREW
      134  O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      135  What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,
      136  dear knight?
    SIR ANDREW
      137  I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason
      138  good enough.
    MARIA
      139  The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing
      140  constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,
      141  that cons state without book and utters it by great
      142  swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so
      143  crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is
      144  his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
      145  him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find
      146  notable cause to work.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      147  What wilt thou do?
    MARIA
      148  I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
      149  love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
      150  of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure
      151  of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find
      152  himself most feelingly personated. I can write very
      153  like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we
      154  can hardly make distinction of our hands.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      155  Excellent! I smell a device.
    SIR ANDREW
      156  I have't in my nose too.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      157  He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,
      158  that they come from my niece, and that she's in
      159  love with him.
    MARIA
      160  My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.
    SIR ANDREW
      161  And your horse now would make him an ass.
    MARIA
      162  Ass, I doubt not.
    SIR ANDREW
      163  O, 'twill be admirable!
    MARIA
      164  Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will
      165  work with him. I will plant you two, and let the
      166  fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:
      167  observe his construction of it. For this night, to
      168  bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
  Direction: Exit
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      169  Good night, Penthesilea.
    SIR ANDREW
      170  Before me, she's a good wench.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      171  She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:
      172  what o' that?
    SIR ANDREW
      173  I was adored once too.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      174  Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for
      175  more money.
    SIR ANDREW
      176  If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      177  Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'
      178  the end, call me cut.
    SIR ANDREW
      179  If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      180  Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late
      181  to go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.
  Direction: Exeunt
