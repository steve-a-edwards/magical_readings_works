          Twelfth Night : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
  Direction: Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords; Musicians attending
    DUKE ORSINO
        1  If music be the food of love, play on;
        2  Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
        3  The appetite may sicken, and so die.
        4  That strain again! it had a dying fall:
        5  O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
        6  That breathes upon a bank of violets,
        7  Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
        8  'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
        9  O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
       10  That, notwithstanding thy capacity
       11  Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
       12  Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
       13  But falls into abatement and low price,
       14  Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
       15  That it alone is high fantastical.
    CURIO
       16  Will you go hunt, my lord?
    DUKE ORSINO
       17  What, Curio?
    CURIO
       18  The hart.
    DUKE ORSINO
       19  Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
       20  O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
       21  Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
       22  That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
       23  And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
       24  E'er since pursue me.
  Direction: Enter VALENTINE
       25  How now! what news from her?
    VALENTINE
       26  So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
       27  But from her handmaid do return this answer:
       28  The element itself, till seven years' heat,
       29  Shall not behold her face at ample view;
       30  But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
       31  And water once a day her chamber round
       32  With eye-offending brine: all this to season
       33  A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
       34  And lasting in her sad remembrance.
    DUKE ORSINO
       35  O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
       36  To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
       37  How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
       38  Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
       39  That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
       40  These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
       41  Her sweet perfections with one self king!
       42  Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
       43  Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
  Direction: Exeunt
