          Twelfth Night : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. The sea-coast.
  Direction: Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
    ANTONIO
        1  Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
    SEBASTIAN
        2  By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
        3  me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
        4  distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
        5  leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
        6  recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
        7  ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
    SEBASTIAN
        8  No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
        9  extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
       10  touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
       11  what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
       12  me in manners the rather to express myself. You
       13  must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
       14  which I called Roderigo. My father was that
       15  Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
       16  of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
       17  born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
       18  would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
       19  for some hour before you took me from the breach of
       20  the sea was my sister drowned.
    ANTONIO
       21  Alas the day!
    SEBASTIAN
       22  A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
       23  me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
       24  though I could not with such estimable wonder
       25  overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
       26  publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but
       27  call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
       28  water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
    ANTONIO
       29  Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
    SEBASTIAN
       30  O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
    ANTONIO
       31  If you will not murder me for my love, let me be
       32  your servant.
    SEBASTIAN
       33  If you will not undo what you have done, that is,
       34  kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
       35  Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
       36  and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
       37  upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
       38  tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.
  Direction: Exit
    ANTONIO
       39  The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
       40  I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
       41  Else would I very shortly see thee there.
       42  But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
       43  That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
  Direction: Exit
