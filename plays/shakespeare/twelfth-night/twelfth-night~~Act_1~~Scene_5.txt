          Twelfth Night : Act 1 : Scene 5

SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.
  Direction: Enter MARIA and Clown
    MARIA
        1  Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
        2  not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
        3  way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
    Clown
        4  Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
        5  world needs to fear no colours.
    MARIA
        6  Make that good.
    Clown
        7  He shall see none to fear.
    MARIA
        8  A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
        9  saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'
    Clown
       10  Where, good Mistress Mary?
    MARIA
       11  In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
    Clown
       12  Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
       13  that are fools, let them use their talents.
    MARIA
       14  Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
       15  to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
    Clown
       16  Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,
       17  for turning away, let summer bear it out.
    MARIA
       18  You are resolute, then?
    Clown
       19  Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.
    MARIA
       20  That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both
       21  break, your gaskins fall.
    Clown
       22  Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if
       23  Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
       24  piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.
    MARIA
       25  Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my
       26  lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.
  Direction: Exit
    Clown
       27  Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!
       28  Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
       29  prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
       30  pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
       31  'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
  Direction: Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO
       32  God bless thee, lady!
    OLIVIA
       33  Take the fool away.
    Clown
       34  Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
    OLIVIA
       35  Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:
       36  besides, you grow dishonest.
    Clown
       37  Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
       38  will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
       39  the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
       40  himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
       41  he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
       42  that's mended is but patched: virtue that
       43  transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
       44  amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
       45  simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
       46  what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
       47  calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
       48  away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.
    OLIVIA
       49  Sir, I bade them take away you.
    Clown
       50  Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
       51  facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
       52  motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to
       53  prove you a fool.
    OLIVIA
       54  Can you do it?
    Clown
       55  Dexterously, good madonna.
    OLIVIA
       56  Make your proof.
    Clown
       57  I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
       58  of virtue, answer me.
    OLIVIA
       59  Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.
    Clown
       60  Good madonna, why mournest thou?
    OLIVIA
       61  Good fool, for my brother's death.
    Clown
       62  I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
    OLIVIA
       63  I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
    Clown
       64  The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
       65  soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
    OLIVIA
       66  What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
    MALVOLIO
       67  Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:
       68  infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
       69  better fool.
    Clown
       70  God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
       71  better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
       72  sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
       73  word for two pence that you are no fool.
    OLIVIA
       74  How say you to that, Malvolio?
    MALVOLIO
       75  I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
       76  barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
       77  with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
       78  than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
       79  already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
       80  him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
       81  that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better
       82  than the fools' zanies.
    OLIVIA
       83  Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
       84  with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
       85  guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
       86  things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
       87  there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
       88  nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
       89  man, though he do nothing but reprove.
    Clown
       90  Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
       91  speakest well of fools!
  Direction: Re-enter MARIA
    MARIA
       92  Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much
       93  desires to speak with you.
    OLIVIA
       94  From the Count Orsino, is it?
    MARIA
       95  I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.
    OLIVIA
       96  Who of my people hold him in delay?
    MARIA
       97  Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
    OLIVIA
       98  Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but
       99  madman: fie on him!
  Direction: Exit MARIA
      100  Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I
      101  am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.
  Direction: Exit MALVOLIO
      102  Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and
      103  people dislike it.
    Clown
      104  Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
      105  son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
      106  brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a
      107  most weak pia mater.
  Direction: Enter SIR TOBY BELCH
    OLIVIA
      108  By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      109  A gentleman.
    OLIVIA
      110  A gentleman! what gentleman?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      111  'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these
      112  pickle-herring! How now, sot!
    Clown
      113  Good Sir Toby!
    OLIVIA
      114  Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      115  Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
    OLIVIA
      116  Ay, marry, what is he?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      117  Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give
      118  me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.
  Direction: Exit
    OLIVIA
      119  What's a drunken man like, fool?
    Clown
      120  Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one
      121  draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads
      122  him; and a third drowns him.
    OLIVIA
      123  Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my
      124  coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's
      125  drowned: go, look after him.
    Clown
      126  He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look
      127  to the madman.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Re-enter MALVOLIO
    MALVOLIO
      128  Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with
      129  you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
      130  understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
      131  with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
      132  have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
      133  comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
      134  lady? he's fortified against any denial.
    OLIVIA
      135  Tell him he shall not speak with me.
    MALVOLIO
      136  Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your
      137  door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to
      138  a bench, but he'll speak with you.
    OLIVIA
      139  What kind o' man is he?
    MALVOLIO
      140  Why, of mankind.
    OLIVIA
      141  What manner of man?
    MALVOLIO
      142  Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.
    OLIVIA
      143  Of what personage and years is he?
    MALVOLIO
      144  Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
      145  a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a
      146  cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
      147  in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
      148  well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
      149  would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
    OLIVIA
      150  Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.
    MALVOLIO
      151  Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Re-enter MARIA
    OLIVIA
      152  Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
      153  We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
  Direction: Enter VIOLA, and Attendants
    VIOLA
      154  The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
    OLIVIA
      155  Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
      156  Your will?
    VIOLA
      157  Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I
      158  pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
      159  for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
      160  my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
      161  penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
      162  beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
      163  comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
    OLIVIA
      164  Whence came you, sir?
    VIOLA
      165  I can say little more than I have studied, and that
      166  question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
      167  modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
      168  that I may proceed in my speech.
    OLIVIA
      169  Are you a comedian?
    VIOLA
      170  No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
      171  of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
      172  the lady of the house?
    OLIVIA
      173  If I do not usurp myself, I am.
    VIOLA
      174  Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
      175  yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
      176  to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
      177  on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
      178  the heart of my message.
    OLIVIA
      179  Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
    VIOLA
      180  Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
    OLIVIA
      181  It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
      182  keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
      183  and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
      184  than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
      185  you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of
      186  moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
    MARIA
      187  Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.
    VIOLA
      188  No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
      189  longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet
      190  lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
    OLIVIA
      191  Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
      192  the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
    VIOLA
      193  It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
      194  war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
      195  hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.
    OLIVIA
      196  Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
    VIOLA
      197  The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
      198  learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
      199  would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
      200  divinity, to any other's, profanation.
    OLIVIA
      201  Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
  Direction: Exeunt MARIA and Attendants
      202  Now, sir, what is your text?
    VIOLA
      203  Most sweet lady,--
    OLIVIA
      204  A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
      205  Where lies your text?
    VIOLA
      206  In Orsino's bosom.
    OLIVIA
      207  In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
    VIOLA
      208  To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
    OLIVIA
      209  O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
    VIOLA
      210  Good madam, let me see your face.
    OLIVIA
      211  Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
      212  with my face? You are now out of your text: but
      213  we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
      214  Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
      215  not well done?
  Direction: Unveiling
    VIOLA
      216  Excellently done, if God did all.
    OLIVIA
      217  'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
    VIOLA
      218  'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
      219  Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
      220  Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
      221  If you will lead these graces to the grave
      222  And leave the world no copy.
    OLIVIA
      223  O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
      224  out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
      225  inventoried, and every particle and utensil
      226  labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
      227  indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
      228  them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were
      229  you sent hither to praise me?
    VIOLA
      230  I see you what you are, you are too proud;
      231  But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
      232  My lord and master loves you: O, such love
      233  Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
      234  The nonpareil of beauty!
    OLIVIA
      235  How does he love me?
    VIOLA
      236  With adorations, fertile tears,
      237  With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
    OLIVIA
      238  Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:
      239  Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
      240  Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
      241  In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
      242  And in dimension and the shape of nature
      243  A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
      244  He might have took his answer long ago.
    VIOLA
      245  If I did love you in my master's flame,
      246  With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
      247  In your denial I would find no sense;
      248  I would not understand it.
    OLIVIA
      249  Why, what would you?
    VIOLA
      250  Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
      251  And call upon my soul within the house;
      252  Write loyal cantons of contemned love
      253  And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
      254  Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
      255  And make the babbling gossip of the air
      256  Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
      257  Between the elements of air and earth,
      258  But you should pity me!
    OLIVIA
      259  You might do much.
      260  What is your parentage?
    VIOLA
      261  Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
      262  I am a gentleman.
    OLIVIA
      263  Get you to your lord;
      264  I cannot love him: let him send no more;
      265  Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
      266  To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
      267  I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
    VIOLA
      268  I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
      269  My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
      270  Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
      271  And let your fervor, like my master's, be
      272  Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
  Direction: Exit
    OLIVIA
      273  'What is your parentage?'
      274  'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
      275  I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;
      276  Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,
      277  Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
      278  soft, soft!
      279  Unless the master were the man. How now!
      280  Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
      281  Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
      282  With an invisible and subtle stealth
      283  To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
      284  What ho, Malvolio!
  Direction: Re-enter MALVOLIO
    MALVOLIO
      285  Here, madam, at your service.
    OLIVIA
      286  Run after that same peevish messenger,
      287  The county's man: he left this ring behind him,
      288  Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
      289  Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
      290  Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:
      291  If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
      292  I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.
    MALVOLIO
      293  Madam, I will.
  Direction: Exit
    OLIVIA
      294  I do I know not what, and fear to find
      295  Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
      296  Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;
      297  What is decreed must be, and be this so.
  Direction: Exit
