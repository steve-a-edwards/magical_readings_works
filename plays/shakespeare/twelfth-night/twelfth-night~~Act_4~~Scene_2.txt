          Twelfth Night : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.
  Direction: Enter MARIA and Clown
    MARIA
        1  Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;
        2  make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do
        3  it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.
  Direction: Exit
    Clown
        4  Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself
        5  in't; and I would I were the first that ever
        6  dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to
        7  become the function well, nor lean enough to be
        8  thought a good student; but to be said an honest man
        9  and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a
       10  careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.
  Direction: Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       11  Jove bless thee, master Parson.
    Clown
       12  Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of
       13  Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily
       14  said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is;'
       15  so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for,
       16  what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       17  To him, Sir Topas.
    Clown
       18  What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       19  The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.
    MALVOLIO
       20  [Within] Who calls there?
    Clown
       21  Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio
       22  the lunatic.
    MALVOLIO
       23  Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.
    Clown
       24  Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!
       25  talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       26  Well said, Master Parson.
    MALVOLIO
       27  Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir
       28  Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me
       29  here in hideous darkness.
    Clown
       30  Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most
       31  modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones
       32  that will use the devil himself with courtesy:
       33  sayest thou that house is dark?
    MALVOLIO
       34  As hell, Sir Topas.
    Clown
       35  Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,
       36  and the clearstores toward the south north are as
       37  lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of
       38  obstruction?
    MALVOLIO
       39  I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.
    Clown
       40  Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness
       41  but ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than
       42  the Egyptians in their fog.
    MALVOLIO
       43  I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though
       44  ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there
       45  was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you
       46  are: make the trial of it in any constant question.
    Clown
       47  What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?
    MALVOLIO
       48  That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
    Clown
       49  What thinkest thou of his opinion?
    MALVOLIO
       50  I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
    Clown
       51  Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:
       52  thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will
       53  allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest
       54  thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.
    MALVOLIO
       55  Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       56  My most exquisite Sir Topas!
    Clown
       57  Nay, I am for all waters.
    MARIA
       58  Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and
       59  gown: he sees thee not.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       60  To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how
       61  thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this
       62  knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I
       63  would he were, for I am now so far in offence with
       64  my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this
       65  sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.
  Direction: Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA
    Clown
       66  [Singing]
       67  'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,
       68  Tell me how thy lady does.'
    MALVOLIO
       69  Fool!
    Clown
       70  'My lady is unkind, perdy.'
    MALVOLIO
       71  Fool!
    Clown
       72  'Alas, why is she so?'
    MALVOLIO
       73  Fool, I say!
    Clown
       74  'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?
    MALVOLIO
       75  Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my
       76  hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:
       77  as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to
       78  thee for't.
    Clown
       79  Master Malvolio?
    MALVOLIO
       80  Ay, good fool.
    Clown
       81  Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?
    MALVOLIO
       82  Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I
       83  am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.
    Clown
       84  But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no
       85  better in your wits than a fool.
    MALVOLIO
       86  They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,
       87  send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to
       88  face me out of my wits.
    Clown
       89  Advise you what you say; the minister is here.
       90  Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!
       91  endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain
       92  bibble babble.
    MALVOLIO
       93  Sir Topas!
    Clown
       94  Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,
       95  sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.
       96  Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.
    MALVOLIO
       97  Fool, fool, fool, I say!
    Clown
       98  Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am
       99  shent for speaking to you.
    MALVOLIO
      100  Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I
      101  tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
    Clown
      102  Well-a-day that you were, sir
    MALVOLIO
      103  By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and
      104  light; and convey what I will set down to my lady:
      105  it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing
      106  of letter did.
    Clown
      107  I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you
      108  not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?
    MALVOLIO
      109  Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.
    Clown
      110  Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his
      111  brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.
    MALVOLIO
      112  Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I
      113  prithee, be gone.
    Clown
      114  [Singing]
      115  I am gone, sir,
      116  And anon, sir,
      117  I'll be with you again,
      118  In a trice,
      119  Like to the old Vice,
      120  Your need to sustain;
      121  Who, with dagger of lath,
      122  In his rage and his wrath,
      123  Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:
      124  Like a mad lad,
      125  Pare thy nails, dad;
      126  Adieu, good man devil.
  Direction: Exit
