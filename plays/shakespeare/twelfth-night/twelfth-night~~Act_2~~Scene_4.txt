          Twelfth Night : Act 2 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.
  Direction: Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others
    DUKE ORSINO
        1  Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
        2  Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
        3  That old and antique song we heard last night:
        4  Methought it did relieve my passion much,
        5  More than light airs and recollected terms
        6  Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
        7  Come, but one verse.
    CURIO
        8  He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.
    DUKE ORSINO
        9  Who was it?
    CURIO
       10  Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady
       11  Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.
    DUKE ORSINO
       12  Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
  Direction: Exit CURIO. Music plays
       13  Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
       14  In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
       15  For such as I am all true lovers are,
       16  Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
       17  Save in the constant image of the creature
       18  That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
    VIOLA
       19  It gives a very echo to the seat
       20  Where Love is throned.
    DUKE ORSINO
       21  Thou dost speak masterly:
       22  My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
       23  Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
       24  Hath it not, boy?
    VIOLA
       25  A little, by your favour.
    DUKE ORSINO
       26  What kind of woman is't?
    VIOLA
       27  Of your complexion.
    DUKE ORSINO
       28  She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
    VIOLA
       29  About your years, my lord.
    DUKE ORSINO
       30  Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
       31  An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
       32  So sways she level in her husband's heart:
       33  For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
       34  Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
       35  More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
       36  Than women's are.
    VIOLA
       37  I think it well, my lord.
    DUKE ORSINO
       38  Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
       39  Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
       40  For women are as roses, whose fair flower
       41  Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.
    VIOLA
       42  And so they are: alas, that they are so;
       43  To die, even when they to perfection grow!
  Direction: Re-enter CURIO and Clown
    DUKE ORSINO
       44  O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
       45  Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;
       46  The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
       47  And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
       48  Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
       49  And dallies with the innocence of love,
       50  Like the old age.
    Clown
       51  Are you ready, sir?
    DUKE ORSINO
       52  Ay; prithee, sing.
  Direction: Music
       53  SONG.
    Clown
       54  Come away, come away, death,
       55  And in sad cypress let me be laid;
       56  Fly away, fly away breath;
       57  I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
       58  My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
       59  O, prepare it!
       60  My part of death, no one so true
       61  Did share it.
       62  Not a flower, not a flower sweet
       63  On my black coffin let there be strown;
       64  Not a friend, not a friend greet
       65  My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
       66  A thousand thousand sighs to save,
       67  Lay me, O, where
       68  Sad true lover never find my grave,
       69  To weep there!
    DUKE ORSINO
       70  There's for thy pains.
    Clown
       71  No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.
    DUKE ORSINO
       72  I'll pay thy pleasure then.
    Clown
       73  Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
    DUKE ORSINO
       74  Give me now leave to leave thee.
    Clown
       75  Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
       76  tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
       77  thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
       78  constancy put to sea, that their business might be
       79  every thing and their intent every where; for that's
       80  it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
  Direction: Exit
    DUKE ORSINO
       81  Let all the rest give place.
  Direction: CURIO and Attendants retire
       82  Once more, Cesario,
       83  Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
       84  Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
       85  Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
       86  The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
       87  Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
       88  But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
       89  That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
    VIOLA
       90  But if she cannot love you, sir?
    DUKE ORSINO
       91  I cannot be so answer'd.
    VIOLA
       92  Sooth, but you must.
       93  Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
       94  Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
       95  As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
       96  You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?
    DUKE ORSINO
       97  There is no woman's sides
       98  Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
       99  As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
      100  So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
      101  Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
      102  No motion of the liver, but the palate,
      103  That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;
      104  But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
      105  And can digest as much: make no compare
      106  Between that love a woman can bear me
      107  And that I owe Olivia.
    VIOLA
      108  Ay, but I know--
    DUKE ORSINO
      109  What dost thou know?
    VIOLA
      110  Too well what love women to men may owe:
      111  In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
      112  My father had a daughter loved a man,
      113  As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
      114  I should your lordship.
    DUKE ORSINO
      115  And what's her history?
    VIOLA
      116  A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
      117  But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
      118  Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
      119  And with a green and yellow melancholy
      120  She sat like patience on a monument,
      121  Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
      122  We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
      123  Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
      124  Much in our vows, but little in our love.
    DUKE ORSINO
      125  But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
    VIOLA
      126  I am all the daughters of my father's house,
      127  And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
      128  Sir, shall I to this lady?
    DUKE ORSINO
      129  Ay, that's the theme.
      130  To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
      131  My love can give no place, bide no denay.
  Direction: Exeunt
