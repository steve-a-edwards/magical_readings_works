          Twelfth Night : Act 3 : Scene 3

SCENE III. A street.
  Direction: Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
    SEBASTIAN
        1  I would not by my will have troubled you;
        2  But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
        3  I will no further chide you.
    ANTONIO
        4  I could not stay behind you: my desire,
        5  More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
        6  And not all love to see you, though so much
        7  As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
        8  But jealousy what might befall your travel,
        9  Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
       10  Unguided and unfriended, often prove
       11  Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
       12  The rather by these arguments of fear,
       13  Set forth in your pursuit.
    SEBASTIAN
       14  My kind Antonio,
       15  I can no other answer make but thanks,
       16  And thanks; and ever [ ] oft good turns
       17  Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
       18  But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
       19  You should find better dealing. What's to do?
       20  Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
    ANTONIO
       21  To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.
    SEBASTIAN
       22  I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:
       23  I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
       24  With the memorials and the things of fame
       25  That do renown this city.
    ANTONIO
       26  Would you'ld pardon me;
       27  I do not without danger walk these streets:
       28  Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys
       29  I did some service; of such note indeed,
       30  That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
    SEBASTIAN
       31  Belike you slew great number of his people.
    ANTONIO
       32  The offence is not of such a bloody nature;
       33  Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
       34  Might well have given us bloody argument.
       35  It might have since been answer'd in repaying
       36  What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
       37  Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
       38  For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
       39  I shall pay dear.
    SEBASTIAN
       40  Do not then walk too open.
    ANTONIO
       41  It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.
       42  In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
       43  Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,
       44  Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
       45  With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
    SEBASTIAN
       46  Why I your purse?
    ANTONIO
       47  Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
       48  You have desire to purchase; and your store,
       49  I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
    SEBASTIAN
       50  I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you
       51  For an hour.
    ANTONIO
       52  To the Elephant.
    SEBASTIAN
       53  I do remember.
  Direction: Exeunt
