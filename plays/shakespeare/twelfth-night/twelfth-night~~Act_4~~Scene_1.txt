          Twelfth Night : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.
  Direction: Enter SEBASTIAN and Clown
    Clown
        1  Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
    SEBASTIAN
        2  Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:
        3  Let me be clear of thee.
    Clown
        4  Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor
        5  I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come
        6  speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario;
        7  nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
    SEBASTIAN
        8  I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou
        9  know'st not me.
    Clown
       10  Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some
       11  great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my
       12  folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,
       13  will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy
       14  strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
       15  lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
    SEBASTIAN
       16  I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's
       17  money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give
       18  worse payment.
    Clown
       19  By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men
       20  that give fools money get themselves a good
       21  report--after fourteen years' purchase.
  Direction: Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN
    SIR ANDREW
       22  Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.
    SEBASTIAN
       23  Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all
       24  the people mad?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       25  Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.
    Clown
       26  This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be
       27  in some of your coats for two pence.
  Direction: Exit
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       28  Come on, sir; hold.
    SIR ANDREW
       29  Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work
       30  with him; I'll have an action of battery against
       31  him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I
       32  struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.
    SEBASTIAN
       33  Let go thy hand.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       34  Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young
       35  soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.
    SEBASTIAN
       36  I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If
       37  thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       38  What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two
       39  of this malapert blood from you.
  Direction: Enter OLIVIA
    OLIVIA
       40  Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       41  Madam!
    OLIVIA
       42  Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
       43  Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
       44  Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!
       45  Be not offended, dear Cesario.
       46  Rudesby, be gone!
  Direction: Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
       47  I prithee, gentle friend,
       48  Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
       49  In this uncivil and thou unjust extent
       50  Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
       51  And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
       52  This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby
       53  Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:
       54  Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
       55  He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
    SEBASTIAN
       56  What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
       57  Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
       58  Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
       59  If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
    OLIVIA
       60  Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!
    SEBASTIAN
       61  Madam, I will.
    OLIVIA
       62  O, say so, and so be!
  Direction: Exeunt
