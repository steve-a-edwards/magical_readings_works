          Twelfth Night : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The sea-coast.
  Direction: Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors
    VIOLA
        1  What country, friends, is this?
    Captain
        2  This is Illyria, lady.
    VIOLA
        3  And what should I do in Illyria?
        4  My brother he is in Elysium.
        5  Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?
    Captain
        6  It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
    VIOLA
        7  O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
    Captain
        8  True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
        9  Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
       10  When you and those poor number saved with you
       11  Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
       12  Most provident in peril, bind himself,
       13  Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
       14  To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
       15  Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
       16  I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
       17  So long as I could see.
    VIOLA
       18  For saying so, there's gold:
       19  Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
       20  Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
       21  The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
    Captain
       22  Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
       23  Not three hours' travel from this very place.
    VIOLA
       24  Who governs here?
    Captain
       25  A noble duke, in nature as in name.
    VIOLA
       26  What is the name?
    Captain
       27  Orsino.
    VIOLA
       28  Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
       29  He was a bachelor then.
    Captain
       30  And so is now, or was so very late;
       31  For but a month ago I went from hence,
       32  And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
       33  What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
       34  That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
    VIOLA
       35  What's she?
    Captain
       36  A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
       37  That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
       38  In the protection of his son, her brother,
       39  Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
       40  They say, she hath abjured the company
       41  And sight of men.
    VIOLA
       42  O that I served that lady
       43  And might not be delivered to the world,
       44  Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
       45  What my estate is!
    Captain
       46  That were hard to compass;
       47  Because she will admit no kind of suit,
       48  No, not the duke's.
    VIOLA
       49  There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
       50  And though that nature with a beauteous wall
       51  Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
       52  I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
       53  With this thy fair and outward character.
       54  I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
       55  Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
       56  For such disguise as haply shall become
       57  The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
       58  Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
       59  It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
       60  And speak to him in many sorts of music
       61  That will allow me very worth his service.
       62  What else may hap to time I will commit;
       63  Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
    Captain
       64  Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
       65  When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
    VIOLA
       66  I thank thee: lead me on.
  Direction: Exeunt
