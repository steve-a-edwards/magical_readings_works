          Twelfth Night : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.
  Direction: Enter Clown and FABIAN
    FABIAN
        1  Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
    Clown
        2  Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
    FABIAN
        3  Any thing.
    Clown
        4  Do not desire to see this letter.
    FABIAN
        5  This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my
        6  dog again.
  Direction: Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords
    DUKE ORSINO
        7  Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
    Clown
        8  Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.
    DUKE ORSINO
        9  I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?
    Clown
       10  Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse
       11  for my friends.
    DUKE ORSINO
       12  Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.
    Clown
       13  No, sir, the worse.
    DUKE ORSINO
       14  How can that be?
    Clown
       15  Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;
       16  now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
       17  my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,
       18  and by my friends, I am abused: so that,
       19  conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives
       20  make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for
       21  my friends and the better for my foes.
    DUKE ORSINO
       22  Why, this is excellent.
    Clown
       23  By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be
       24  one of my friends.
    DUKE ORSINO
       25  Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
    Clown
       26  But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would
       27  you could make it another.
    DUKE ORSINO
       28  O, you give me ill counsel.
    Clown
       29  Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,
       30  and let your flesh and blood obey it.
    DUKE ORSINO
       31  Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a
       32  double-dealer: there's another.
    Clown
       33  Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old
       34  saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,
       35  sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of
       36  Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.
    DUKE ORSINO
       37  You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
       38  if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
       39  with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake
       40  my bounty further.
    Clown
       41  Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come
       42  again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think
       43  that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
       44  but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I
       45  will awake it anon.
  Direction: Exit
    VIOLA
       46  Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
  Direction: Enter ANTONIO and Officers
    DUKE ORSINO
       47  That face of his I do remember well;
       48  Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
       49  As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
       50  A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
       51  For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
       52  With which such scathful grapple did he make
       53  With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
       54  That very envy and the tongue of loss
       55  Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
    First Officer
       56  Orsino, this is that Antonio
       57  That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
       58  And this is he that did the Tiger board,
       59  When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
       60  Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
       61  In private brabble did we apprehend him.
    VIOLA
       62  He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
       63  But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
       64  I know not what 'twas but distraction.
    DUKE ORSINO
       65  Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
       66  What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
       67  Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
       68  Hast made thine enemies?
    ANTONIO
       69  Orsino, noble sir,
       70  Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
       71  Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
       72  Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
       73  Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
       74  That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
       75  From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
       76  Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
       77  His life I gave him and did thereto add
       78  My love, without retention or restraint,
       79  All his in dedication; for his sake
       80  Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
       81  Into the danger of this adverse town;
       82  Drew to defend him when he was beset:
       83  Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
       84  Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
       85  Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
       86  And grew a twenty years removed thing
       87  While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
       88  Which I had recommended to his use
       89  Not half an hour before.
    VIOLA
       90  How can this be?
    DUKE ORSINO
       91  When came he to this town?
    ANTONIO
       92  To-day, my lord; and for three months before,
       93  No interim, not a minute's vacancy,
       94  Both day and night did we keep company.
  Direction: Enter OLIVIA and Attendants
    DUKE ORSINO
       95  Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
       96  But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:
       97  Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
       98  But more of that anon. Take him aside.
    OLIVIA
       99  What would my lord, but that he may not have,
      100  Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
      101  Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
    VIOLA
      102  Madam!
    DUKE ORSINO
      103  Gracious Olivia,--
    OLIVIA
      104  What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--
    VIOLA
      105  My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
    OLIVIA
      106  If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
      107  It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
      108  As howling after music.
    DUKE ORSINO
      109  Still so cruel?
    OLIVIA
      110  Still so constant, lord.
    DUKE ORSINO
      111  What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
      112  To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
      113  My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
      114  That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
    OLIVIA
      115  Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
    DUKE ORSINO
      116  Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
      117  Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
      118  Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
      119  That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
      120  Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
      121  And that I partly know the instrument
      122  That screws me from my true place in your favour,
      123  Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
      124  But this your minion, whom I know you love,
      125  And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
      126  Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
      127  Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
      128  Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
      129  I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
      130  To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
    VIOLA
      131  And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
      132  To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
    OLIVIA
      133  Where goes Cesario?
    VIOLA
      134  After him I love
      135  More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
      136  More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
      137  If I do feign, you witnesses above
      138  Punish my life for tainting of my love!
    OLIVIA
      139  Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
    VIOLA
      140  Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
    OLIVIA
      141  Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
      142  Call forth the holy father.
    DUKE ORSINO
      143  Come, away!
    OLIVIA
      144  Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
    DUKE ORSINO
      145  Husband!
    OLIVIA
      146  Ay, husband: can he that deny?
    DUKE ORSINO
      147  Her husband, sirrah!
    VIOLA
      148  No, my lord, not I.
    OLIVIA
      149  Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
      150  That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
      151  Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
      152  Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
      153  As great as that thou fear'st.
  Direction: Enter Priest
      154  O, welcome, father!
      155  Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
      156  Here to unfold, though lately we intended
      157  To keep in darkness what occasion now
      158  Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
      159  Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
    Priest
      160  A contract of eternal bond of love,
      161  Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
      162  Attested by the holy close of lips,
      163  Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
      164  And all the ceremony of this compact
      165  Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
      166  Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
      167  I have travell'd but two hours.
    DUKE ORSINO
      168  O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
      169  When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
      170  Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
      171  That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
      172  Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
      173  Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
    VIOLA
      174  My lord, I do protest--
    OLIVIA
      175  O, do not swear!
      176  Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
  Direction: Enter SIR ANDREW
    SIR ANDREW
      177  For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
      178  to Sir Toby.
    OLIVIA
      179  What's the matter?
    SIR ANDREW
      180  He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
      181  a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
      182  help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
    OLIVIA
      183  Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
    SIR ANDREW
      184  The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for
      185  a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
    DUKE ORSINO
      186  My gentleman, Cesario?
    SIR ANDREW
      187  'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
      188  nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't
      189  by Sir Toby.
    VIOLA
      190  Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
      191  You drew your sword upon me without cause;
      192  But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.
    SIR ANDREW
      193  If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
      194  think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
  Direction: Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown
      195  Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:
      196  but if he had not been in drink, he would have
      197  tickled you othergates than he did.
    DUKE ORSINO
      198  How now, gentleman! how is't with you?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      199  That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end
      200  on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?
    Clown
      201  O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
      202  were set at eight i' the morning.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      203  Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I
      204  hate a drunken rogue.
    OLIVIA
      205  Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
    SIR ANDREW
      206  I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      207  Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
      208  knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
    OLIVIA
      209  Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.
  Direction: Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW
  Direction: Enter SEBASTIAN
    SEBASTIAN
      210  I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:
      211  But, had it been the brother of my blood,
      212  I must have done no less with wit and safety.
      213  You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
      214  I do perceive it hath offended you:
      215  Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
      216  We made each other but so late ago.
    DUKE ORSINO
      217  One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
      218  A natural perspective, that is and is not!
    SEBASTIAN
      219  Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
      220  How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,
      221  Since I have lost thee!
    ANTONIO
      222  Sebastian are you?
    SEBASTIAN
      223  Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
    ANTONIO
      224  How have you made division of yourself?
      225  An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
      226  Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
    OLIVIA
      227  Most wonderful!
    SEBASTIAN
      228  Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
      229  Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
      230  Of here and every where. I had a sister,
      231  Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
      232  Of charity, what kin are you to me?
      233  What countryman? what name? what parentage?
    VIOLA
      234  Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
      235  Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
      236  So went he suited to his watery tomb:
      237  If spirits can assume both form and suit
      238  You come to fright us.
    SEBASTIAN
      239  A spirit I am indeed;
      240  But am in that dimension grossly clad
      241  Which from the womb I did participate.
      242  Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
      243  I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
      244  And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'
    VIOLA
      245  My father had a mole upon his brow.
    SEBASTIAN
      246  And so had mine.
    VIOLA
      247  And died that day when Viola from her birth
      248  Had number'd thirteen years.
    SEBASTIAN
      249  O, that record is lively in my soul!
      250  He finished indeed his mortal act
      251  That day that made my sister thirteen years.
    VIOLA
      252  If nothing lets to make us happy both
      253  But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
      254  Do not embrace me till each circumstance
      255  Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
      256  That I am Viola: which to confirm,
      257  I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
      258  Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
      259  I was preserved to serve this noble count.
      260  All the occurrence of my fortune since
      261  Hath been between this lady and this lord.
    SEBASTIAN
      262  [To OLIVIA] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
      263  But nature to her bias drew in that.
      264  You would have been contracted to a maid;
      265  Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
      266  You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
    DUKE ORSINO
      267  Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
      268  If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
      269  I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
  Direction: To VIOLA
      270  Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
      271  Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
    VIOLA
      272  And all those sayings will I overswear;
      273  And those swearings keep as true in soul
      274  As doth that orbed continent the fire
      275  That severs day from night.
    DUKE ORSINO
      276  Give me thy hand;
      277  And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
    VIOLA
      278  The captain that did bring me first on shore
      279  Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
      280  Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
      281  A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.
    OLIVIA
      282  He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
      283  And yet, alas, now I remember me,
      284  They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
  Direction: Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN
      285  A most extracting frenzy of mine own
      286  From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
      287  How does he, sirrah?
    Clown
      288  Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
      289  well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
      290  letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
      291  morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
      292  so it skills not much when they are delivered.
    OLIVIA
      293  Open't, and read it.
    Clown
      294  Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
      295  the madman.
  Direction: Reads
      296  'By the Lord, madam,'--
    OLIVIA
      297  How now! art thou mad?
    Clown
      298  No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
      299  will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.
    OLIVIA
      300  Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
    Clown
      301  So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to
      302  read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
    OLIVIA
      303  Read it you, sirrah.
  Direction: To FABIAN
    FABIAN
      304  [Reads] 'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
      305  world shall know it: though you have put me into
      306  darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
      307  me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
      308  your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
      309  me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
      310  not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
      311  Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
      312  unthought of and speak out of my injury.
      313  THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
    OLIVIA
      314  Did he write this?
    Clown
      315  Ay, madam.
    DUKE ORSINO
      316  This savours not much of distraction.
    OLIVIA
      317  See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.
  Direction: Exit FABIAN
      318  My lord so please you, these things further
      319  thought on,
      320  To think me as well a sister as a wife,
      321  One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
      322  Here at my house and at my proper cost.
    DUKE ORSINO
      323  Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
  Direction: To VIOLA
      324  Your master quits you; and for your service done him,
      325  So much against the mettle of your sex,
      326  So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
      327  And since you call'd me master for so long,
      328  Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
      329  Your master's mistress.
    OLIVIA
      330  A sister! you are she.
  Direction: Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO
    DUKE ORSINO
      331  Is this the madman?
    OLIVIA
      332  Ay, my lord, this same.
      333  How now, Malvolio!
    MALVOLIO
      334  Madam, you have done me wrong,
      335  Notorious wrong.
    OLIVIA
      336  Have I, Malvolio? no.
    MALVOLIO
      337  Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
      338  You must not now deny it is your hand:
      339  Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
      340  Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:
      341  You can say none of this: well, grant it then
      342  And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
      343  Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
      344  Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
      345  To put on yellow stockings and to frown
      346  Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
      347  And, acting this in an obedient hope,
      348  Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
      349  Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
      350  And made the most notorious geck and gull
      351  That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
    OLIVIA
      352  Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
      353  Though, I confess, much like the character
      354  But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
      355  And now I do bethink me, it was she
      356  First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,
      357  And in such forms which here were presupposed
      358  Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
      359  This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
      360  But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
      361  Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
      362  Of thine own cause.
    FABIAN
      363  Good madam, hear me speak,
      364  And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
      365  Taint the condition of this present hour,
      366  Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
      367  Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
      368  Set this device against Malvolio here,
      369  Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
      370  We had conceived against him: Maria writ
      371  The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
      372  In recompense whereof he hath married her.
      373  How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
      374  May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
      375  If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
      376  That have on both sides pass'd.
    OLIVIA
      377  Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
    Clown
      378  Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
      379  and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
      380  one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
      381  that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
      382  But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
      383  a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
      384  and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
    MALVOLIO
      385  I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.

      386  He hath been most notoriously abused.
    DUKE ORSINO
      387  Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
      388  He hath not told us of the captain yet:
      389  When that is known and golden time convents,
      390  A solemn combination shall be made
      391  Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
      392  We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;
      393  For so you shall be, while you are a man;
      394  But when in other habits you are seen,
      395  Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.

      396  [Sings]
      397  When that I was and a little tiny boy,
      398  With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
      399  A foolish thing was but a toy,
      400  For the rain it raineth every day.
      401  But when I came to man's estate,
      402  With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
      403  'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
      404  For the rain it raineth every day
      405  But when I came, alas! to wive,
      406  With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
      407  By swaggering could I never thrive,
      408  For the rain it raineth every day.
      409  But when I came unto my beds,
      410  With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
      411  With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
      412  For the rain it raineth every day.
      413  A great while ago the world begun,
      414  With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
      415  But that's all one, our play is done,
      416  And we'll strive to please you every day.
