          Twelfth Night : Act 3 : Scene 2

SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.
  Direction: Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
    SIR ANDREW
        1  No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
        2  Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
    FABIAN
        3  You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
    SIR ANDREW
        4  Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the
        5  count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;
        6  I saw't i' the orchard.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
        7  Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.
    SIR ANDREW
        8  As plain as I see you now.
    FABIAN
        9  This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
    SIR ANDREW
       10  'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
    FABIAN
       11  I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
       12  judgment and reason.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       13  And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah
       14  was a sailor.
    FABIAN
       15  She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
       16  to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to
       17  put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
       18  You should then have accosted her; and with some
       19  excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should
       20  have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
       21  looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the
       22  double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
       23  off, and you are now sailed into the north of my
       24  lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle
       25  on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by
       26  some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
    SIR ANDREW
       27  An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy
       28  I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
       29  politician.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       30  Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
       31  valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
       32  with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
       33  take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no
       34  love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
       35  commendation with woman than report of valour.
    FABIAN
       36  There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
    SIR ANDREW
       37  Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       38  Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;
       39  it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun
       40  of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
       41  if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be
       42  amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
       43  paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
       44  bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.
       45  Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou
       46  write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.
    SIR ANDREW
       47  Where shall I find you?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       48  We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.
  Direction: Exit SIR ANDREW
    FABIAN
       49  This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       50  I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand
       51  strong, or so.
    FABIAN
       52  We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll
       53  not deliver't?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       54  Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the
       55  youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
       56  cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
       57  opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
       58  will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of
       59  the anatomy.
    FABIAN
       60  And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no
       61  great presage of cruelty.
  Direction: Enter MARIA
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       62  Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.
    MARIA
       63  If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself
       64  into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is
       65  turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no
       66  Christian, that means to be saved by believing
       67  rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages
       68  of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       69  And cross-gartered?
    MARIA
       70  Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school
       71  i' the church. I have dogged him, like his
       72  murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
       73  that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
       74  face into more lines than is in the new map with the
       75  augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
       76  a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
       77  at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,
       78  he'll smile and take't for a great favour.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       79  Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
  Direction: Exeunt
