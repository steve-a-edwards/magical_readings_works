          Twelfth Night : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.
  Direction: Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour
    VIOLA
        1  Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
        2  thy tabour?
    Clown
        3  No, sir, I live by the church.
    VIOLA
        4  Art thou a churchman?
    Clown
        5  No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for
        6  I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
        7  the church.
    VIOLA
        8  So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a
        9  beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy
       10  tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.
    Clown
       11  You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
       12  but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
       13  wrong side may be turned outward!
    VIOLA
       14  Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with
       15  words may quickly make them wanton.
    Clown
       16  I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.
    VIOLA
       17  Why, man?
    Clown
       18  Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that
       19  word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
       20  are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
    VIOLA
       21  Thy reason, man?
    Clown
       22  Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and
       23  words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
       24  reason with them.
    VIOLA
       25  I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
    Clown
       26  Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my
       27  conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be
       28  to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
    VIOLA
       29  Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
    Clown
       30  No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she
       31  will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and
       32  fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
       33  herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not
       34  her fool, but her corrupter of words.
    VIOLA
       35  I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
    Clown
       36  Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
       37  it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
       38  the fool should be as oft with your master as with
       39  my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
    VIOLA
       40  Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
       41  Hold, there's expenses for thee.
    Clown
       42  Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
    VIOLA
       43  By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for
       44  one;
  Direction: Aside
       45  though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
       46  lady within?
    Clown
       47  Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
    VIOLA
       48  Yes, being kept together and put to use.
    Clown
       49  I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring
       50  a Cressida to this Troilus.
    VIOLA
       51  I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.
    Clown
       52  The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but
       53  a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
       54  within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
       55  come; who you are and what you would are out of my
       56  welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.
  Direction: Exit
    VIOLA
       57  This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
       58  And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
       59  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
       60  The quality of persons, and the time,
       61  And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather
       62  That comes before his eye. This is a practise
       63  As full of labour as a wise man's art
       64  For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
       65  But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
  Direction: Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       66  Save you, gentleman.
    VIOLA
       67  And you, sir.
    SIR ANDREW
       68  Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
    VIOLA
       69  Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.
    SIR ANDREW
       70  I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       71  Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous
       72  you should enter, if your trade be to her.
    VIOLA
       73  I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the
       74  list of my voyage.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       75  Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.
    VIOLA
       76  My legs do better understand me, sir, than I
       77  understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       78  I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
    VIOLA
       79  I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
       80  are prevented.
  Direction: Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
       81  Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain
       82  odours on you!
    SIR ANDREW
       83  That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.
    VIOLA
       84  My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant
       85  and vouchsafed ear.
    SIR ANDREW
       86  'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em
       87  all three all ready.
    OLIVIA
       88  Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
  Direction: Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA
       89  Give me your hand, sir.
    VIOLA
       90  My duty, madam, and most humble service.
    OLIVIA
       91  What is your name?
    VIOLA
       92  Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
    OLIVIA
       93  My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
       94  Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
       95  You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
    VIOLA
       96  And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
       97  Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
    OLIVIA
       98  For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
       99  Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!
    VIOLA
      100  Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
      101  On his behalf.
    OLIVIA
      102  O, by your leave, I pray you,
      103  I bade you never speak again of him:
      104  But, would you undertake another suit,
      105  I had rather hear you to solicit that
      106  Than music from the spheres.
    VIOLA
      107  Dear lady,--
    OLIVIA
      108  Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
      109  After the last enchantment you did here,
      110  A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
      111  Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:
      112  Under your hard construction must I sit,
      113  To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
      114  Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
      115  Have you not set mine honour at the stake
      116  And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
      117  That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
      118  Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
      119  Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
    VIOLA
      120  I pity you.
    OLIVIA
      121  That's a degree to love.
    VIOLA
      122  No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,
      123  That very oft we pity enemies.
    OLIVIA
      124  Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.
      125  O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
      126  If one should be a prey, how much the better
      127  To fall before the lion than the wolf!
  Direction: Clock strikes
      128  The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
      129  Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
      130  And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
      131  Your were is alike to reap a proper man:
      132  There lies your way, due west.
    VIOLA
      133  Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
      134  Attend your ladyship!
      135  You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
    OLIVIA
      136  Stay:
      137  I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
    VIOLA
      138  That you do think you are not what you are.
    OLIVIA
      139  If I think so, I think the same of you.
    VIOLA
      140  Then think you right: I am not what I am.
    OLIVIA
      141  I would you were as I would have you be!
    VIOLA
      142  Would it be better, madam, than I am?
      143  I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
    OLIVIA
      144  O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
      145  In the contempt and anger of his lip!
      146  A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
      147  Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
      148  Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
      149  By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
      150  I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
      151  Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
      152  Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
      153  For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
      154  But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
      155  Love sought is good, but given unsought better.
    VIOLA
      156  By innocence I swear, and by my youth
      157  I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,
      158  And that no woman has; nor never none
      159  Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
      160  And so adieu, good madam: never more
      161  Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
    OLIVIA
      162  Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
      163  That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
  Direction: Exeunt
