          Twelfth Night : Act 2 : Scene 5

SCENE V. OLIVIA's garden.
  Direction: Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
    SIR TOBY BELCH
        1  Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
    FABIAN
        2  Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,
        3  let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
        4  Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
        5  rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
    FABIAN
        6  I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'
        7  favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
        8  To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will
        9  fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?
    SIR ANDREW
       10  An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       11  Here comes the little villain.
  Direction: Enter MARIA
       12  How now, my metal of India!
    MARIA
       13  Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
       14  coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
       15  sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
       16  hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I
       17  know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
       18  him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,
  Direction: Throws down a letter
       19  for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter MALVOLIO
    MALVOLIO
       20  'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told
       21  me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
       22  thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one
       23  of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more
       24  exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
       25  What should I think on't?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       26  Here's an overweening rogue!
    FABIAN
       27  O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock
       28  of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!
    SIR ANDREW
       29  'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       30  Peace, I say.
    MALVOLIO
       31  To be Count Malvolio!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       32  Ah, rogue!
    SIR ANDREW
       33  Pistol him, pistol him.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       34  Peace, peace!
    MALVOLIO
       35  There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy
       36  married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
    SIR ANDREW
       37  Fie on him, Jezebel!
    FABIAN
       38  O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how
       39  imagination blows him.
    MALVOLIO
       40  Having been three months married to her, sitting in
       41  my state,--
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       42  O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
    MALVOLIO
       43  Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet
       44  gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left
       45  Olivia sleeping,--
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       46  Fire and brimstone!
    FABIAN
       47  O, peace, peace!
    MALVOLIO
       48  And then to have the humour of state; and after a
       49  demure travel of regard, telling them I know my
       50  place as I would they should do theirs, to for my
       51  kinsman Toby,--
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       52  Bolts and shackles!
    FABIAN
       53  O peace, peace, peace! now, now.
    MALVOLIO
       54  Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make
       55  out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind
       56  up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby
       57  approaches; courtesies there to me,--
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       58  Shall this fellow live?
    FABIAN
       59  Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
    MALVOLIO
       60  I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar
       61  smile with an austere regard of control,--
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       62  And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
    MALVOLIO
       63  Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on
       64  your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       65  What, what?
    MALVOLIO
       66  'You must amend your drunkenness.'
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       67  Out, scab!
    FABIAN
       68  Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
    MALVOLIO
       69  'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with
       70  a foolish knight,'--
    SIR ANDREW
       71  That's me, I warrant you.
    MALVOLIO
       72  'One Sir Andrew,'--
    SIR ANDREW
       73  I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.
    MALVOLIO
       74  What employment have we here?
  Direction: Taking up the letter
    FABIAN
       75  Now is the woodcock near the gin.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       76  O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading
       77  aloud to him!
    MALVOLIO
       78  By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her
       79  very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her
       80  great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
    SIR ANDREW
       81  Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?
    MALVOLIO
       82  [Reads] 'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
       83  wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
       84  Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she
       85  uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?
    FABIAN
       86  This wins him, liver and all.
    MALVOLIO
       87  [Reads]
       88  Jove knows I love: But who?
       89  Lips, do not move;
       90  No man must know.
       91  'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers
       92  altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be
       93  thee, Malvolio?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       94  Marry, hang thee, brock!
    MALVOLIO
       95  [Reads]
       96  I may command where I adore;
       97  But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
       98  With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:
       99  M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.
    FABIAN
      100  A fustian riddle!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      101  Excellent wench, say I.
    MALVOLIO
      102  'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let
      103  me see, let me see, let me see.
    FABIAN
      104  What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      105  And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!
    MALVOLIO
      106  'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command
      107  me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is
      108  evident to any formal capacity; there is no
      109  obstruction in this: and the end,--what should
      110  that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
      111  that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,
      112  I,--
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      113  O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.
    FABIAN
      114  Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as
      115  rank as a fox.
    MALVOLIO
      116  M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.
    FABIAN
      117  Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is
      118  excellent at faults.
    MALVOLIO
      119  M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;
      120  that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.
    FABIAN
      121  And O shall end, I hope.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      122  Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!
    MALVOLIO
      123  And then I comes behind.
    FABIAN
      124  Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see
      125  more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
      126  you.
    MALVOLIO
      127  M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
      128  yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
      129  every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
      130  here follows prose.
  Direction: Reads
      131  'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
      132  am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
      133  are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
      134  have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
      135  their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
      136  and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
      137  cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
      138  opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
      139  thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
      140  the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
      141  that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
      142  yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
      143  cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
      144  made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
      145  thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
      146  not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
      147  She that would alter services with thee,
      148  THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'
      149  Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
      150  open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
      151  I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
      152  acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
      153  I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
      154  me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
      155  loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
      156  late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
      157  and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
      158  with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
      159  of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
      160  be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
      161  cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
      162  on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
      163  postscript.
  Direction: Reads
      164  'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
      165  entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
      166  thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
      167  presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
      168  Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
      169  everything that thou wilt have me.
  Direction: Exit
    FABIAN
      170  I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
      171  of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      172  I could marry this wench for this device.
    SIR ANDREW
      173  So could I too.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      174  And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
    SIR ANDREW
      175  Nor I neither.
    FABIAN
      176  Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
  Direction: Re-enter MARIA
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      177  Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
    SIR ANDREW
      178  Or o' mine either?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      179  Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy
      180  bond-slave?
    SIR ANDREW
      181  I' faith, or I either?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      182  Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when
      183  the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
    MARIA
      184  Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      185  Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
    MARIA
      186  If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark
      187  his first approach before my lady: he will come to
      188  her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she
      189  abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;
      190  and he will smile upon her, which will now be so
      191  unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
      192  melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him
      193  into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow
      194  me.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      195  To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
    SIR ANDREW
      196  I'll make one too.
  Direction: Exeunt
