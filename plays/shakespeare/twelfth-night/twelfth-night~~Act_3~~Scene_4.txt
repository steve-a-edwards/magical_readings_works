          Twelfth Night : Act 3 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.
  Direction: Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
    OLIVIA
        1  I have sent after him: he says he'll come;
        2  How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
        3  For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
        4  I speak too loud.
        5  Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,
        6  And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
        7  Where is Malvolio?
    MARIA
        8  He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He
        9  is, sure, possessed, madam.
    OLIVIA
       10  Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
    MARIA
       11  No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
       12  ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if
       13  he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.
    OLIVIA
       14  Go call him hither.
  Direction: Exit MARIA
       15  I am as mad as he,
       16  If sad and merry madness equal be.
  Direction: Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO
       17  How now, Malvolio!
    MALVOLIO
       18  Sweet lady, ho, ho.
    OLIVIA
       19  Smilest thou?
       20  I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
    MALVOLIO
       21  Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some
       22  obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but
       23  what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is
       24  with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and
       25  please all.'
    OLIVIA
       26  Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
    MALVOLIO
       27  Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It
       28  did come to his hands, and commands shall be
       29  executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
    OLIVIA
       30  Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
    MALVOLIO
       31  To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.
    OLIVIA
       32  God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
       33  thy hand so oft?
    MARIA
       34  How do you, Malvolio?
    MALVOLIO
       35  At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.
    MARIA
       36  Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
    MALVOLIO
       37  'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.
    OLIVIA
       38  What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
    MALVOLIO
       39  'Some are born great,'--
    OLIVIA
       40  Ha!
    MALVOLIO
       41  'Some achieve greatness,'--
    OLIVIA
       42  What sayest thou?
    MALVOLIO
       43  'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
    OLIVIA
       44  Heaven restore thee!
    MALVOLIO
       45  'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--
    OLIVIA
       46  Thy yellow stockings!
    MALVOLIO
       47  'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
    OLIVIA
       48  Cross-gartered!
    MALVOLIO
       49  'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--
    OLIVIA
       50  Am I made?
    MALVOLIO
       51  'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'
    OLIVIA
       52  Why, this is very midsummer madness.
  Direction: Enter Servant
    Servant
       53  Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is
       54  returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
       55  attends your ladyship's pleasure.
    OLIVIA
       56  I'll come to him.
  Direction: Exit Servant
       57  Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's
       58  my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
       59  care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
       60  half of my dowry.
  Direction: Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA
    MALVOLIO
       61  O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than
       62  Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
       63  the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
       64  appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that
       65  in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;
       66  'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
       67  let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
       68  thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
       69  consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
       70  face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
       71  habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
       72  limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
       73  thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
       74  fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
       75  after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
       76  adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
       77  scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
       78  or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
       79  that can be can come between me and the full
       80  prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the
       81  doer of this, and he is to be thanked.
  Direction: Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       82  Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all
       83  the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion
       84  himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.
    FABIAN
       85  Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?
       86  how is't with you, man?
    MALVOLIO
       87  Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go
       88  off.
    MARIA
       89  Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not
       90  I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a
       91  care of him.
    MALVOLIO
       92  Ah, ha! does she so?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
       93  Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently
       94  with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how
       95  is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
       96  consider, he's an enemy to mankind.
    MALVOLIO
       97  Do you know what you say?
    MARIA
       98  La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes
       99  it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!
    FABIAN
      100  Carry his water to the wise woman.
    MARIA
      101  Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I
      102  live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
    MALVOLIO
      103  How now, mistress!
    MARIA
      104  O Lord!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      105  Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do
      106  you not see you move him? let me alone with him.
    FABIAN
      107  No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is
      108  rough, and will not be roughly used.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      109  Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?
    MALVOLIO
      110  Sir!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      111  Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for
      112  gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang
      113  him, foul collier!
    MARIA
      114  Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
    MALVOLIO
      115  My prayers, minx!
    MARIA
      116  No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
    MALVOLIO
      117  Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow
      118  things: I am not of your element: you shall know
      119  more hereafter.
  Direction: Exit
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      120  Is't possible?
    FABIAN
      121  If this were played upon a stage now, I could
      122  condemn it as an improbable fiction.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      123  His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.
    MARIA
      124  Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
    FABIAN
      125  Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
    MARIA
      126  The house will be the quieter.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      127  Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My
      128  niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we
      129  may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,
      130  till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt
      131  us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
      132  bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
      133  finder of madmen. But see, but see.
  Direction: Enter SIR ANDREW
    FABIAN
      134  More matter for a May morning.
    SIR ANDREW
      135  Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's
      136  vinegar and pepper in't.
    FABIAN
      137  Is't so saucy?
    SIR ANDREW
      138  Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      139  Give me.
  Direction: Reads
      140  'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'
    FABIAN
      141  Good, and valiant.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      142  [Reads] 'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,
      143  why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'
    FABIAN
      144  A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      145  [Reads] 'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my
      146  sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy
      147  throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'
    FABIAN
      148  Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      149  [Reads] 'I will waylay thee going home; where if it
      150  be thy chance to kill me,'--
    FABIAN
      151  Good.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      152  [Reads] 'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'
    FABIAN
      153  Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      154  [Reads] 'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon
      155  one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but
      156  my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy
      157  friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,
      158  ANDREW AGUECHEEK.
      159  If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:
      160  I'll give't him.
    MARIA
      161  You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in
      162  some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      163  Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the
      164  orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest
      165  him, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; for
      166  it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a
      167  swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood
      168  more approbation than ever proof itself would have
      169  earned him. Away!
    SIR ANDREW
      170  Nay, let me alone for swearing.
  Direction: Exit
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      171  Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior
      172  of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
      173  capacity and breeding; his employment between his
      174  lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
      175  letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no
      176  terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
      177  clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by
      178  word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report
      179  of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his
      180  youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous
      181  opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.
      182  This will so fright them both that they will kill
      183  one another by the look, like cockatrices.
  Direction: Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA
    FABIAN
      184  Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
      185  he take leave, and presently after him.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      186  I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
      187  for a challenge.
  Direction: Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA
    OLIVIA
      188  I have said too much unto a heart of stone
      189  And laid mine honour too unchary out:
      190  There's something in me that reproves my fault;
      191  But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
      192  That it but mocks reproof.
    VIOLA
      193  With the same 'havior that your passion bears
      194  Goes on my master's grief.
    OLIVIA
      195  Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;
      196  Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
      197  And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
      198  What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
      199  That honour saved may upon asking give?
    VIOLA
      200  Nothing but this; your true love for my master.
    OLIVIA
      201  How with mine honour may I give him that
      202  Which I have given to you?
    VIOLA
      203  I will acquit you.
    OLIVIA
      204  Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:
      205  A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      206  Gentleman, God save thee.
    VIOLA
      207  And you, sir.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      208  That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what
      209  nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
      210  not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
      211  the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:
      212  dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
      213  thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.
    VIOLA
      214  You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel
      215  to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
      216  any image of offence done to any man.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      217  You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,
      218  if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
      219  your guard; for your opposite hath in him what
      220  youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.
    VIOLA
      221  I pray you, sir, what is he?
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      222  He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
      223  carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private
      224  brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
      225  his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
      226  that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
      227  and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.
    VIOLA
      228  I will return again into the house and desire some
      229  conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
      230  of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
      231  others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
      232  of that quirk.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      233  Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a
      234  very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
      235  give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
      236  house, unless you undertake that with me which with
      237  as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
      238  or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you
      239  must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
    VIOLA
      240  This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
      241  this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
      242  my offence to him is: it is something of my
      243  negligence, nothing of my purpose.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      244  I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this
      245  gentleman till my return.
  Direction: Exit
    VIOLA
      246  Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
    FABIAN
      247  I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a
      248  mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.
    VIOLA
      249  I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
    FABIAN
      250  Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by
      251  his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
      252  of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
      253  bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
      254  have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
      255  towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
      256  can.
    VIOLA
      257  I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
      258  had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
      259  care not who knows so much of my mettle.
  Direction: Exeunt
  Direction: Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      260  Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
      261  firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
      262  all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
      263  motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
      264  pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
      265  step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
    SIR ANDREW
      266  Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      267  Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
      268  scarce hold him yonder.
    SIR ANDREW
      269  Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
      270  cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld
      271  have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
      272  and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      273  I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
      274  on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
  Direction: Aside
      275  Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
  Direction: Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA
  Direction: To FABIAN
      276  I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
      277  I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
    FABIAN
      278  He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and
      279  looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      280  [To VIOLA] There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
      281  with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better
      282  bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
      283  scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for
      284  the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.
    VIOLA
      285  [Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would
      286  make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
    FABIAN
      287  Give ground, if you see him furious.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      288  Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman
      289  will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;
      290  he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
      291  promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
      292  will not hurt you. Come on; to't.
    SIR ANDREW
      293  Pray God, he keep his oath!
    VIOLA
      294  I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
  Direction: They draw
  Direction: Enter ANTONIO
    ANTONIO
      295  Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
      296  Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
      297  If you offend him, I for him defy you.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      298  You, sir! why, what are you?
    ANTONIO
      299  One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
      300  Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      301  Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
  Direction: They draw
  Direction: Enter Officers
    FABIAN
      302  O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      303  I'll be with you anon.
    VIOLA
      304  Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
    SIR ANDREW
      305  Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,
      306  I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
      307  and reins well.
    First Officer
      308  This is the man; do thy office.
    Second Officer
      309  Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
    ANTONIO
      310  You do mistake me, sir.
    First Officer
      311  No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
      312  Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
      313  Take him away: he knows I know him well.
    ANTONIO
      314  I must obey.
  Direction: To VIOLA
      315  This comes with seeking you:
      316  But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.
      317  What will you do, now my necessity
      318  Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
      319  Much more for what I cannot do for you
      320  Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
      321  But be of comfort.
    Second Officer
      322  Come, sir, away.
    ANTONIO
      323  I must entreat of you some of that money.
    VIOLA
      324  What money, sir?
      325  For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
      326  And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,
      327  Out of my lean and low ability
      328  I'll lend you something: my having is not much;
      329  I'll make division of my present with you:
      330  Hold, there's half my coffer.
    ANTONIO
      331  Will you deny me now?
      332  Is't possible that my deserts to you
      333  Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
      334  Lest that it make me so unsound a man
      335  As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
      336  That I have done for you.
    VIOLA
      337  I know of none;
      338  Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
      339  I hate ingratitude more in a man
      340  Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
      341  Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
      342  Inhabits our frail blood.
    ANTONIO
      343  O heavens themselves!
    Second Officer
      344  Come, sir, I pray you, go.
    ANTONIO
      345  Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
      346  I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
      347  Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
      348  And to his image, which methought did promise
      349  Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
    First Officer
      350  What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
    ANTONIO
      351  But O how vile an idol proves this god
      352  Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
      353  In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
      354  None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
      355  Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
      356  Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
    First Officer
      357  The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.
    ANTONIO
      358  Lead me on.
  Direction: Exit with Officers
    VIOLA
      359  Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
      360  That he believes himself: so do not I.
      361  Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
      362  That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      363  Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll
      364  whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
    VIOLA
      365  He named Sebastian: I my brother know
      366  Yet living in my glass; even such and so
      367  In favour was my brother, and he went
      368  Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
      369  For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
      370  Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
  Direction: Exit
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      371  A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than
      372  a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his
      373  friend here in necessity and denying him; and for
      374  his cowardship, ask Fabian.
    FABIAN
      375  A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
    SIR ANDREW
      376  'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      377  Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.
    SIR ANDREW
      378  An I do not,--
    FABIAN
      379  Come, let's see the event.
    SIR TOBY BELCH
      380  I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.
  Direction: Exeunt
