          Twelfth Night : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A street.
  Direction: Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following
    MALVOLIO
        1  Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
    VIOLA
        2  Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since
        3  arrived but hither.
    MALVOLIO
        4  She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
        5  saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
        6  She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
        7  into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
        8  and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
        9  come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
       10  your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
    VIOLA
       11  She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
    MALVOLIO
       12  Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her
       13  will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth
       14  stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be
       15  it his that finds it.
  Direction: Exit
    VIOLA
       16  I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
       17  Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
       18  She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
       19  That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
       20  For she did speak in starts distractedly.
       21  She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
       22  Invites me in this churlish messenger.
       23  None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
       24  I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
       25  Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
       26  Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
       27  Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
       28  How easy is it for the proper-false
       29  In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
       30  Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
       31  For such as we are made of, such we be.
       32  How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;
       33  And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
       34  And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
       35  What will become of this? As I am man,
       36  My state is desperate for my master's love;
       37  As I am woman,--now alas the day!--
       38  What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
       39  O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
       40  It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
  Direction: Exit
