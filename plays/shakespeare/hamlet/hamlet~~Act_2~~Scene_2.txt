          Hamlet : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A room in the castle.
  Direction: Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants
    KING CLAUDIUS
        1  Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
        2  Moreover that we much did long to see you,
        3  The need we have to use you did provoke
        4  Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
        5  Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
        6  Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
        7  Resembles that it was. What it should be,
        8  More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
        9  So much from the understanding of himself,
       10  I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
       11  That, being of so young days brought up with him,
       12  And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
       13  That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
       14  Some little time: so by your companies
       15  To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
       16  So much as from occasion you may glean,
       17  Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
       18  That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       19  Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
       20  And sure I am two men there are not living
       21  To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
       22  To show us so much gentry and good will
       23  As to expend your time with us awhile,
       24  For the supply and profit of our hope,
       25  Your visitation shall receive such thanks
       26  As fits a king's remembrance.
    ROSENCRANTZ
       27  Both your majesties
       28  Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
       29  Put your dread pleasures more into command
       30  Than to entreaty.
    GUILDENSTERN
       31  But we both obey,
       32  And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
       33  To lay our service freely at your feet,
       34  To be commanded.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       35  Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       36  Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
       37  And I beseech you instantly to visit
       38  My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
       39  And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
    GUILDENSTERN
       40  Heavens make our presence and our practises
       41  Pleasant and helpful to him!
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       42  Ay, amen!
  Direction: Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants
  Direction: Enter POLONIUS
    LORD POLONIUS
       43  The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
       44  Are joyfully return'd.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       45  Thou still hast been the father of good news.
    LORD POLONIUS
       46  Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
       47  I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
       48  Both to my God and to my gracious king:
       49  And I do think, or else this brain of mine
       50  Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
       51  As it hath used to do, that I have found
       52  The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       53  O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
    LORD POLONIUS
       54  Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
       55  My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       56  Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
  Direction: Exit POLONIUS
       57  He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
       58  The head and source of all your son's distemper.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       59  I doubt it is no other but the main;
       60  His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       61  Well, we shall sift him.
  Direction: Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
       62  Welcome, my good friends!
       63  Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
    VOLTIMAND
       64  Most fair return of greetings and desires.
       65  Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
       66  His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
       67  To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
       68  But, better look'd into, he truly found
       69  It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
       70  That so his sickness, age and impotence
       71  Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
       72  On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
       73  Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
       74  Makes vow before his uncle never more
       75  To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
       76  Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
       77  Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
       78  And his commission to employ those soldiers,
       79  So levied as before, against the Polack:
       80  With an entreaty, herein further shown,
  Direction: Giving a paper
       81  That it might please you to give quiet pass
       82  Through your dominions for this enterprise,
       83  On such regards of safety and allowance
       84  As therein are set down.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       85  It likes us well;
       86  And at our more consider'd time well read,
       87  Answer, and think upon this business.
       88  Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
       89  Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
       90  Most welcome home!
  Direction: Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
    LORD POLONIUS
       91  This business is well ended.
       92  My liege, and madam, to expostulate
       93  What majesty should be, what duty is,
       94  Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
       95  Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
       96  Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
       97  And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
       98  I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
       99  Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
      100  What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
      101  But let that go.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      102  More matter, with less art.
    LORD POLONIUS
      103  Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
      104  That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
      105  And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
      106  But farewell it, for I will use no art.
      107  Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
      108  That we find out the cause of this effect,
      109  Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
      110  For this effect defective comes by cause:
      111  Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
      112  I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
      113  Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
      114  Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
  Direction: Reads
      115  'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
      116  beautified Ophelia,'
      117  That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
      118  a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
  Direction: Reads
      119  'In her excellent white bosom, these, and c.'
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      120  Came this from Hamlet to her?
    LORD POLONIUS
      121  Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
  Direction: Reads
      122  'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
      123  Doubt that the sun doth move;
      124  Doubt truth to be a liar;
      125  But never doubt I love.
      126  'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
      127  I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
      128  I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
      129  'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
      130  this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
      131  This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
      132  And more above, hath his solicitings,
      133  As they fell out by time, by means and place,
      134  All given to mine ear.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      135  But how hath she
      136  Received his love?
    LORD POLONIUS
      137  What do you think of me?
    KING CLAUDIUS
      138  As of a man faithful and honourable.
    LORD POLONIUS
      139  I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
      140  When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
      141  As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
      142  Before my daughter told me--what might you,
      143  Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
      144  If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
      145  Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
      146  Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
      147  What might you think? No, I went round to work,
      148  And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
      149  'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
      150  This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
      151  That she should lock herself from his resort,
      152  Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
      153  Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
      154  And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
      155  Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
      156  Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
      157  Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
      158  Into the madness wherein now he raves,
      159  And all we mourn for.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      160  Do you think 'tis this?
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      161  It may be, very likely.
    LORD POLONIUS
      162  Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
      163  That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
      164  When it proved otherwise?
    KING CLAUDIUS
      165  Not that I know.
    LORD POLONIUS
      166  [Pointing to his head and shoulder]
      167  Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
      168  If circumstances lead me, I will find
      169  Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
      170  Within the centre.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      171  How may we try it further?
    LORD POLONIUS
      172  You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
      173  Here in the lobby.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      174  So he does indeed.
    LORD POLONIUS
      175  At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
      176  Be you and I behind an arras then;
      177  Mark the encounter: if he love her not
      178  And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
      179  Let me be no assistant for a state,
      180  But keep a farm and carters.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      181  We will try it.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      182  But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
    LORD POLONIUS
      183  Away, I do beseech you, both away:
      184  I'll board him presently.
  Direction: Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants
  Direction: Enter HAMLET, reading
      185  O, give me leave:
      186  How does my good Lord Hamlet?
    HAMLET
      187  Well, God-a-mercy.
    LORD POLONIUS
      188  Do you know me, my lord?
    HAMLET
      189  Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
    LORD POLONIUS
      190  Not I, my lord.
    HAMLET
      191  Then I would you were so honest a man.
    LORD POLONIUS
      192  Honest, my lord!
    HAMLET
      193  Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
      194  one man picked out of ten thousand.
    LORD POLONIUS
      195  That's very true, my lord.
    HAMLET
      196  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
      197  god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
    LORD POLONIUS
      198  I have, my lord.
    HAMLET
      199  Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
      200  blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
      201  Friend, look to 't.
    LORD POLONIUS
      202  [Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
      203  daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
      204  was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
      205  truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
      206  love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
      207  What do you read, my lord?
    HAMLET
      208  Words, words, words.
    LORD POLONIUS
      209  What is the matter, my lord?
    HAMLET
      210  Between who?
    LORD POLONIUS
      211  I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
    HAMLET
      212  Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
      213  that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
      214  wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
      215  plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
      216  wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
      217  though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
      218  I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
      219  yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
      220  you could go backward.
    LORD POLONIUS
      221  [Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method
      222  in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
    HAMLET
      223  Into my grave.
    LORD POLONIUS
      224  Indeed, that is out o' the air.
  Direction: Aside
      225  How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
      226  that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
      227  could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
      228  leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
      229  meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
      230  lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
    HAMLET
      231  You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
      232  more willingly part withal: except my life, except
      233  my life, except my life.
    LORD POLONIUS
      234  Fare you well, my lord.
    HAMLET
      235  These tedious old fools!
  Direction: Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    LORD POLONIUS
      236  You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      237  [To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!
  Direction: Exit POLONIUS
    GUILDENSTERN
      238  My honoured lord!
    ROSENCRANTZ
      239  My most dear lord!
    HAMLET
      240  My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
      241  Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      242  As the indifferent children of the earth.
    GUILDENSTERN
      243  Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
      244  On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
    HAMLET
      245  Nor the soles of her shoe?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      246  Neither, my lord.
    HAMLET
      247  Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
      248  her favours?
    GUILDENSTERN
      249  'Faith, her privates we.
    HAMLET
      250  In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
      251  is a strumpet. What's the news?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      252  None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
    HAMLET
      253  Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
      254  Let me question more in particular: what have you,
      255  my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
      256  that she sends you to prison hither?
    GUILDENSTERN
      257  Prison, my lord!
    HAMLET
      258  Denmark's a prison.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      259  Then is the world one.
    HAMLET
      260  A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
      261  wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      262  We think not so, my lord.
    HAMLET
      263  Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
      264  either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
      265  it is a prison.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      266  Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
      267  narrow for your mind.
    HAMLET
      268  O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
      269  myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
      270  have bad dreams.
    GUILDENSTERN
      271  Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
      272  substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
    HAMLET
      273  A dream itself is but a shadow.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      274  Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
      275  quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
    HAMLET
      276  Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
      277  outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
      278  to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
    ROSENCRANTZ
    GUILDENSTERN
      279  We'll wait upon you.
    HAMLET
      280  No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
      281  of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
      282  man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
      283  beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      284  To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
    HAMLET
      285  Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
      286  thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
      287  too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
      288  your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
      289  deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
    GUILDENSTERN
      290  What should we say, my lord?
    HAMLET
      291  Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
      292  for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
      293  which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
      294  I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      295  To what end, my lord?
    HAMLET
      296  That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
      297  the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
      298  our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
      299  love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
      300  charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
      301  whether you were sent for, or no?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      302  [Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?
    HAMLET
      303  [Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
      304  love me, hold not off.
    GUILDENSTERN
      305  My lord, we were sent for.
    HAMLET
      306  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
      307  prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
      308  and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
      309  wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
      310  custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
      311  with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
      312  earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
      313  excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
      314  o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
      315  with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
      316  me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
      317  What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
      318  how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
      319  express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
      320  in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
      321  world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
      322  what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
      323  me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
      324  you seem to say so.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      325  My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
    HAMLET
      326  Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      327  To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
      328  lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
      329  you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
      330  coming, to offer you service.
    HAMLET
      331  He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
      332  shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
      333  shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
      334  sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
      335  in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
      336  lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
      337  say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
      338  for't. What players are they?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      339  Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
      340  tragedians of the city.
    HAMLET
      341  How chances it they travel? their residence, both
      342  in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      343  I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
      344  late innovation.
    HAMLET
      345  Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
      346  in the city? are they so followed?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      347  No, indeed, are they not.
    HAMLET
      348  How comes it? do they grow rusty?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      349  Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
      350  there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
      351  that cry out on the top of question, and are most
      352  tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
      353  fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
      354  call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
      355  goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
    HAMLET
      356  What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
      357  they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
      358  longer than they can sing? will they not say
      359  afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
      360  players--as it is most like, if their means are no
      361  better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
      362  exclaim against their own succession?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      363  'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
      364  the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
      365  controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
      366  for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
      367  cuffs in the question.
    HAMLET
      368  Is't possible?
    GUILDENSTERN
      369  O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
    HAMLET
      370  Do the boys carry it away?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      371  Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
    HAMLET
      372  It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
      373  Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
      374  my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
      375  hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
      376  'Sblood, there is something in this more than
      377  natural, if philosophy could find it out.
  Direction: Flourish of trumpets within
    GUILDENSTERN
      378  There are the players.
    HAMLET
      379  Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
      380  come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
      381  and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
      382  lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
      383  must show fairly outward, should more appear like
      384  entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
      385  uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
    GUILDENSTERN
      386  In what, my dear lord?
    HAMLET
      387  I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
      388  southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
  Direction: Enter POLONIUS
    LORD POLONIUS
      389  Well be with you, gentlemen!
    HAMLET
      390  Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
      391  hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
      392  out of his swaddling-clouts.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      393  Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
      394  say an old man is twice a child.
    HAMLET
      395  I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
      396  mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
      397  'twas so indeed.
    LORD POLONIUS
      398  My lord, I have news to tell you.
    HAMLET
      399  My lord, I have news to tell you.
      400  When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
    LORD POLONIUS
      401  The actors are come hither, my lord.
    HAMLET
      402  Buz, buz!
    LORD POLONIUS
      403  Upon mine honour,--
    HAMLET
      404  Then came each actor on his ass,--
    LORD POLONIUS
      405  The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
      406  comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
      407  historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
      408  comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
      409  poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
      410  Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
      411  liberty, these are the only men.
    HAMLET
      412  O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
    LORD POLONIUS
      413  What a treasure had he, my lord?
    HAMLET
      414  Why,
      415  'One fair daughter and no more,
      416  The which he loved passing well.'
    LORD POLONIUS
      417  [Aside] Still on my daughter.
    HAMLET
      418  Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
    LORD POLONIUS
      419  If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
      420  that I love passing well.
    HAMLET
      421  Nay, that follows not.
    LORD POLONIUS
      422  What follows, then, my lord?
    HAMLET
      423  Why,
      424  'As by lot, God wot,'
      425  and then, you know,
      426  'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
      427  the first row of the pious chanson will show you
      428  more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
  Direction: Enter four or five Players
      429  You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
      430  to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
      431  friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
      432  comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
      433  lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
      434  nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
      435  altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
      436  apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
      437  ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
      438  to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
      439  we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
      440  of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
    First Player
      441  What speech, my lord?
    HAMLET
      442  I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
      443  never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
      444  play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
      445  caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
      446  it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
      447  cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
      448  digested in the scenes, set down with as much
      449  modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
      450  were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
      451  savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
      452  indict the author of affectation; but called it an
      453  honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
      454  much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
      455  chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
      456  thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
      457  Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
      458  at this line: let me see, let me see--
      459  'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
      460  it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
      461  'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
      462  Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
      463  When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
      464  Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
      465  With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
      466  Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
      467  With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
      468  Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
      469  That lend a tyrannous and damned light
      470  To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
      471  And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
      472  With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
      473  Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
      474  So, proceed you.
    LORD POLONIUS
      475  'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
      476  good discretion.
    First Player
      477  'Anon he finds him
      478  Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
      479  Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      480  Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
      481  Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
      482  But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
      483  The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      484  Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      485  Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      486  Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
      487  Which was declining on the milky head
      488  Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
      489  So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      490  And like a neutral to his will and matter,
      491  Did nothing.
      492  But, as we often see, against some storm,
      493  A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
      494  The bold winds speechless and the orb below
      495  As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
      496  Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
      497  Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
      498  And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
      499  On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
      500  With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
      501  Now falls on Priam.
      502  Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
      503  In general synod 'take away her power;
      504  Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      505  And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
      506  As low as to the fiends!'
    LORD POLONIUS
      507  This is too long.
    HAMLET
      508  It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
      509  say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
      510  sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
    First Player
      511  'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
    HAMLET
      512  'The mobled queen?'
    LORD POLONIUS
      513  That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
    First Player
      514  'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
      515  With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
      516  Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      517  About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
      518  A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
      519  Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
      520  'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
      521  pronounced:
      522  But if the gods themselves did see her then
      523  When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      524  In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
      525  The instant burst of clamour that she made,
      526  Unless things mortal move them not at all,
      527  Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
      528  And passion in the gods.'
    LORD POLONIUS
      529  Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
      530  tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
    HAMLET
      531  'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
      532  Good my lord, will you see the players well
      533  bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
      534  they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
      535  time: after your death you were better have a bad
      536  epitaph than their ill report while you live.
    LORD POLONIUS
      537  My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
    HAMLET
      538  God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
      539  after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
      540  Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
      541  they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
      542  Take them in.
    LORD POLONIUS
      543  Come, sirs.
    HAMLET
      544  Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
  Direction: Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First
      545  Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
      546  Murder of Gonzago?
    First Player
      547  Ay, my lord.
    HAMLET
      548  We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
      549  study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
      550  I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
    First Player
      551  Ay, my lord.
    HAMLET
      552  Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
      553  not.

      554  My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
      555  welcome to Elsinore.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      556  Good my lord!
    HAMLET
      557  Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
  Direction: Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
      558  Now I am alone.
      559  O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
      560  Is it not monstrous that this player here,
      561  But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
      562  Could force his soul so to his own conceit
      563  That from her working all his visage wann'd,
      564  Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
      565  A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
      566  With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
      567  For Hecuba!
      568  What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
      569  That he should weep for her? What would he do,
      570  Had he the motive and the cue for passion
      571  That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
      572  And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
      573  Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
      574  Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
      575  The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
      576  A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
      577  Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
      578  And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
      579  Upon whose property and most dear life
      580  A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
      581  Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
      582  Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
      583  Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
      584  As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
      585  Ha!
      586  'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
      587  But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
      588  To make oppression bitter, or ere this
      589  I should have fatted all the region kites
      590  With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
      591  Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
      592  O, vengeance!
      593  Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
      594  That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
      595  Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
      596  Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
      597  And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
      598  A scullion!
      599  Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
      600  That guilty creatures sitting at a play
      601  Have by the very cunning of the scene
      602  Been struck so to the soul that presently
      603  They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
      604  For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
      605  With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
      606  Play something like the murder of my father
      607  Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
      608  I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
      609  I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
      610  May be the devil: and the devil hath power
      611  To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
      612  Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
      613  As he is very potent with such spirits,
      614  Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
      615  More relative than this: the play 's the thing
      616  Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
