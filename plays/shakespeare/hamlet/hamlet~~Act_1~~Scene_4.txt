          Hamlet : Act 1 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. The platform.
  Direction: Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS
    HAMLET
        1  The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
    HORATIO
        2  It is a nipping and an eager air.
    HAMLET
        3  What hour now?
    HORATIO
        4  I think it lacks of twelve.
    HAMLET
        5  No, it is struck.
    HORATIO
        6  Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
        7  Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
  Direction: A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
        8  What does this mean, my lord?
    HAMLET
        9  The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
       10  Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
       11  And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
       12  The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
       13  The triumph of his pledge.
    HORATIO
       14  Is it a custom?
    HAMLET
       15  Ay, marry, is't:
       16  But to my mind, though I am native here
       17  And to the manner born, it is a custom
       18  More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
       19  This heavy-headed revel east and west
       20  Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
       21  They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
       22  Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
       23  From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
       24  The pith and marrow of our attribute.
       25  So, oft it chances in particular men,
       26  That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
       27  As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
       28  Since nature cannot choose his origin--
       29  By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
       30  Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
       31  Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
       32  The form of plausive manners, that these men,
       33  Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
       34  Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
       35  Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
       36  As infinite as man may undergo--
       37  Shall in the general censure take corruption
       38  From that particular fault: the dram of eale
       39  Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
       40  To his own scandal.
    HORATIO
       41  Look, my lord, it comes!
  Direction: Enter Ghost
    HAMLET
       42  Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
       43  Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
       44  Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
       45  Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
       46  Thou comest in such a questionable shape
       47  That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
       48  King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
       49  Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
       50  Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
       51  Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
       52  Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
       53  Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
       54  To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
       55  That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
       56  Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
       57  Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
       58  So horridly to shake our disposition
       59  With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
       60  Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
  Direction: Ghost beckons HAMLET
    HORATIO
       61  It beckons you to go away with it,
       62  As if it some impartment did desire
       63  To you alone.
    MARCELLUS
       64  Look, with what courteous action
       65  It waves you to a more removed ground:
       66  But do not go with it.
    HORATIO
       67  No, by no means.
    HAMLET
       68  It will not speak; then I will follow it.
    HORATIO
       69  Do not, my lord.
    HAMLET
       70  Why, what should be the fear?
       71  I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
       72  And for my soul, what can it do to that,
       73  Being a thing immortal as itself?
       74  It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
    HORATIO
       75  What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
       76  Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
       77  That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
       78  And there assume some other horrible form,
       79  Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
       80  And draw you into madness? think of it:
       81  The very place puts toys of desperation,
       82  Without more motive, into every brain
       83  That looks so many fathoms to the sea
       84  And hears it roar beneath.
    HAMLET
       85  It waves me still.
       86  Go on; I'll follow thee.
    MARCELLUS
       87  You shall not go, my lord.
    HAMLET
       88  Hold off your hands.
    HORATIO
       89  Be ruled; you shall not go.
    HAMLET
       90  My fate cries out,
       91  And makes each petty artery in this body
       92  As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
       93  Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
       94  By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
       95  I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
  Direction: Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET
    HORATIO
       96  He waxes desperate with imagination.
    MARCELLUS
       97  Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
    HORATIO
       98  Have after. To what issue will this come?
    MARCELLUS
       99  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
    HORATIO
      100  Heaven will direct it.
    MARCELLUS
      101  Nay, let's follow him.
  Direction: Exeunt
