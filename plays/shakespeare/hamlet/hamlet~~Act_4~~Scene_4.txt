          Hamlet : Act 4 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.
  Direction: Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching
    PRINCE FORTINBRAS
        1  Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
        2  Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
        3  Craves the conveyance of a promised march
        4  Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
        5  If that his majesty would aught with us,
        6  We shall express our duty in his eye;
        7  And let him know so.
    Captain
        8  I will do't, my lord.
    PRINCE FORTINBRAS
        9  Go softly on.
  Direction: Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers
  Direction: Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others
    HAMLET
       10  Good sir, whose powers are these?
    Captain
       11  They are of Norway, sir.
    HAMLET
       12  How purposed, sir, I pray you?
    Captain
       13  Against some part of Poland.
    HAMLET
       14  Who commands them, sir?
    Captain
       15  The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
    HAMLET
       16  Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
       17  Or for some frontier?
    Captain
       18  Truly to speak, and with no addition,
       19  We go to gain a little patch of ground
       20  That hath in it no profit but the name.
       21  To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
       22  Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
       23  A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
    HAMLET
       24  Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
    Captain
       25  Yes, it is already garrison'd.
    HAMLET
       26  Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
       27  Will not debate the question of this straw:
       28  This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
       29  That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
       30  Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
    Captain
       31  God be wi' you, sir.
  Direction: Exit
    ROSENCRANTZ
       32  Wilt please you go, my lord?
    HAMLET
       33  I'll be with you straight go a little before.
  Direction: Exeunt all except HAMLET
       34  How all occasions do inform against me,
       35  And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
       36  If his chief good and market of his time
       37  Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
       38  Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
       39  Looking before and after, gave us not
       40  That capability and god-like reason
       41  To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
       42  Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
       43  Of thinking too precisely on the event,
       44  A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
       45  And ever three parts coward, I do not know
       46  Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
       47  Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
       48  To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
       49  Witness this army of such mass and charge
       50  Led by a delicate and tender prince,
       51  Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
       52  Makes mouths at the invisible event,
       53  Exposing what is mortal and unsure
       54  To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
       55  Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
       56  Is not to stir without great argument,
       57  But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
       58  When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
       59  That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
       60  Excitements of my reason and my blood,
       61  And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
       62  The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
       63  That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
       64  Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
       65  Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
       66  Which is not tomb enough and continent
       67  To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
       68  My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
  Direction: Exit
