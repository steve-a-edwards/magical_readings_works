          Hamlet : Act 3 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.
  Direction: Enter HAMLET and Players
    HAMLET
        1  Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
        2  you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
        3  as many of your players do, I had as lief the
        4  town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
        5  too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
        6  for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
        7  the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
        8  a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
        9  offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
       10  periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
       11  very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
       12  for the most part are capable of nothing but
       13  inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
       14  a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
       15  out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
    First Player
       16  I warrant your honour.
    HAMLET
       17  Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
       18  be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
       19  word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
       20  the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
       21  from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
       22  first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
       23  mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
       24  scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
       25  the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
       26  or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
       27  laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
       28  censure of the which one must in your allowance
       29  o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
       30  players that I have seen play, and heard others
       31  praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
       32  that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
       33  the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
       34  strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
       35  nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
       36  well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
    First Player
       37  I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
       38  sir.
    HAMLET
       39  O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
       40  your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
       41  for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
       42  set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
       43  too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
       44  question of the play be then to be considered:
       45  that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
       46  in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
  Direction: Exeunt Players
  Direction: Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
       47  How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
    LORD POLONIUS
       48  And the queen too, and that presently.
    HAMLET
       49  Bid the players make haste.
  Direction: Exit POLONIUS
       50  Will you two help to hasten them?
    ROSENCRANTZ
    GUILDENSTERN
       51  We will, my lord.
  Direction: Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    HAMLET
       52  What ho! Horatio!
  Direction: Enter HORATIO
    HORATIO
       53  Here, sweet lord, at your service.
    HAMLET
       54  Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
       55  As e'er my conversation coped withal.
    HORATIO
       56  O, my dear lord,--
    HAMLET
       57  Nay, do not think I flatter;
       58  For what advancement may I hope from thee
       59  That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
       60  To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
       61  No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
       62  And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
       63  Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
       64  Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
       65  And could of men distinguish, her election
       66  Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
       67  As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
       68  A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
       69  Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
       70  Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
       71  That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
       72  To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
       73  That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
       74  In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
       75  As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
       76  There is a play to-night before the king;
       77  One scene of it comes near the circumstance
       78  Which I have told thee of my father's death:
       79  I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
       80  Even with the very comment of thy soul
       81  Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
       82  Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
       83  It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
       84  And my imaginations are as foul
       85  As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
       86  For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
       87  And after we will both our judgments join
       88  In censure of his seeming.
    HORATIO
       89  Well, my lord:
       90  If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
       91  And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
    HAMLET
       92  They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
       93  Get you a place.
  Direction: Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others
    KING CLAUDIUS
       94  How fares our cousin Hamlet?
    HAMLET
       95  Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
       96  the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       97  I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
       98  are not mine.
    HAMLET
       99  No, nor mine now.
  Direction: To POLONIUS
      100  My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
    LORD POLONIUS
      101  That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
    HAMLET
      102  What did you enact?
    LORD POLONIUS
      103  I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
      104  Capitol; Brutus killed me.
    HAMLET
      105  It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
      106  there. Be the players ready?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      107  Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      108  Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
    HAMLET
      109  No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
    LORD POLONIUS
      110  [To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
    HAMLET
      111  Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
  Direction: Lying down at OPHELIA's feet
    OPHELIA
      112  No, my lord.
    HAMLET
      113  I mean, my head upon your lap?
    OPHELIA
      114  Ay, my lord.
    HAMLET
      115  Do you think I meant country matters?
    OPHELIA
      116  I think nothing, my lord.
    HAMLET
      117  That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
    OPHELIA
      118  What is, my lord?
    HAMLET
      119  Nothing.
    OPHELIA
      120  You are merry, my lord.
    HAMLET
      121  Who, I?
    OPHELIA
      122  Ay, my lord.
    HAMLET
      123  O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
      124  but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
      125  mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
    OPHELIA
      126  Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
    HAMLET
      127  So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
      128  I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
      129  months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
      130  hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
      131  a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
      132  then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
      133  the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
      134  the hobby-horse is forgot.'
  Direction: Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters
  Direction: Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love
  Direction: Exeunt
    OPHELIA
      135  What means this, my lord?
    HAMLET
      136  Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
    OPHELIA
      137  Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
  Direction: Enter Prologue
    HAMLET
      138  We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
      139  keep counsel; they'll tell all.
    OPHELIA
      140  Will he tell us what this show meant?
    HAMLET
      141  Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
      142  ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
    OPHELIA
      143  You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
    Prologue
      144  For us, and for our tragedy,
      145  Here stooping to your clemency,
      146  We beg your hearing patiently.
  Direction: Exit
    HAMLET
      147  Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
    OPHELIA
      148  'Tis brief, my lord.
    HAMLET
      149  As woman's love.
  Direction: Enter two Players, King and Queen
    Player King
      150  Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      151  Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      152  And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
      153  About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      154  Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
      155  Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
    Player Queen
      156  So many journeys may the sun and moon
      157  Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
      158  But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
      159  So far from cheer and from your former state,
      160  That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      161  Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
      162  For women's fear and love holds quantity;
      163  In neither aught, or in extremity.
      164  Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      165  And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
      166  Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      167  Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
    Player King
      168  'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      169  My operant powers their functions leave to do:
      170  And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
      171  Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
      172  For husband shalt thou--
    Player Queen
      173  O, confound the rest!
      174  Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
      175  In second husband let me be accurst!
      176  None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
    HAMLET
      177  [Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.
    Player Queen
      178  The instances that second marriage move
      179  Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
      180  A second time I kill my husband dead,
      181  When second husband kisses me in bed.
    Player King
      182  I do believe you think what now you speak;
      183  But what we do determine oft we break.
      184  Purpose is but the slave to memory,
      185  Of violent birth, but poor validity;
      186  Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
      187  But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
      188  Most necessary 'tis that we forget
      189  To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
      190  What to ourselves in passion we propose,
      191  The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      192  The violence of either grief or joy
      193  Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
      194  Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
      195  Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
      196  This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      197  That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      198  For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      199  Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
      200  The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
      201  The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
      202  And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
      203  For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      204  And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      205  Directly seasons him his enemy.
      206  But, orderly to end where I begun,
      207  Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      208  That our devices still are overthrown;
      209  Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
      210  So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
      211  But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    Player Queen
      212  Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
      213  Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
      214  To desperation turn my trust and hope!
      215  An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
      216  Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
      217  Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
      218  Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      219  If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
    HAMLET
      220  If she should break it now!
    Player King
      221  'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
      222  My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      223  The tedious day with sleep.
  Direction: Sleeps
    Player Queen
      224  Sleep rock thy brain,
      225  And never come mischance between us twain!
  Direction: Exit
    HAMLET
      226  Madam, how like you this play?
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      227  The lady protests too much, methinks.
    HAMLET
      228  O, but she'll keep her word.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      229  Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
    HAMLET
      230  No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
      231  i' the world.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      232  What do you call the play?
    HAMLET
      233  The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
      234  is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
      235  the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
      236  anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
      237  that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
      238  touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
      239  withers are unwrung.
  Direction: Enter LUCIANUS
      240  This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
    OPHELIA
      241  You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
    HAMLET
      242  I could interpret between you and your love, if I
      243  could see the puppets dallying.
    OPHELIA
      244  You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
    HAMLET
      245  It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
    OPHELIA
      246  Still better, and worse.
    HAMLET
      247  So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
      248  pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
      249  'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
    LUCIANUS
      250  Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
      251  Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
      252  Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      253  With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      254  Thy natural magic and dire property,
      255  On wholesome life usurp immediately.
  Direction: Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears
    HAMLET
      256  He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
      257  name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
      258  choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
      259  gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
    OPHELIA
      260  The king rises.
    HAMLET
      261  What, frighted with false fire!
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      262  How fares my lord?
    LORD POLONIUS
      263  Give o'er the play.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      264  Give me some light: away!
    All
      265  Lights, lights, lights!
  Direction: Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO
    HAMLET
      266  Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
      267  The hart ungalled play;
      268  For some must watch, while some must sleep:
      269  So runs the world away.
      270  Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
      271  the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
      272  Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
      273  fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
    HORATIO
      274  Half a share.
    HAMLET
      275  A whole one, I.
      276  For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
      277  This realm dismantled was
      278  Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
      279  A very, very--pajock.
    HORATIO
      280  You might have rhymed.
    HAMLET
      281  O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
      282  thousand pound. Didst perceive?
    HORATIO
      283  Very well, my lord.
    HAMLET
      284  Upon the talk of the poisoning?
    HORATIO
      285  I did very well note him.
    HAMLET
      286  Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
      287  For if the king like not the comedy,
      288  Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
      289  Come, some music!
  Direction: Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    GUILDENSTERN
      290  Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
    HAMLET
      291  Sir, a whole history.
    GUILDENSTERN
      292  The king, sir,--
    HAMLET
      293  Ay, sir, what of him?
    GUILDENSTERN
      294  Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
    HAMLET
      295  With drink, sir?
    GUILDENSTERN
      296  No, my lord, rather with choler.
    HAMLET
      297  Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
      298  signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
      299  to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
      300  more choler.
    GUILDENSTERN
      301  Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
      302  start not so wildly from my affair.
    HAMLET
      303  I am tame, sir: pronounce.
    GUILDENSTERN
      304  The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
      305  spirit, hath sent me to you.
    HAMLET
      306  You are welcome.
    GUILDENSTERN
      307  Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
      308  breed. If it shall please you to make me a
      309  wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
      310  commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
      311  shall be the end of my business.
    HAMLET
      312  Sir, I cannot.
    GUILDENSTERN
      313  What, my lord?
    HAMLET
      314  Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
      315  sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
      316  or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
      317  more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
    ROSENCRANTZ
      318  Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
      319  into amazement and admiration.
    HAMLET
      320  O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
      321  is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
      322  admiration? Impart.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      323  She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
      324  go to bed.
    HAMLET
      325  We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
      326  you any further trade with us?
    ROSENCRANTZ
      327  My lord, you once did love me.
    HAMLET
      328  So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      329  Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
      330  do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
      331  you deny your griefs to your friend.
    HAMLET
      332  Sir, I lack advancement.
    ROSENCRANTZ
      333  How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
      334  himself for your succession in Denmark?
    HAMLET
      335  Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
      336  is something musty.
  Direction: Re-enter Players with recorders
      337  O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
      338  you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
      339  as if you would drive me into a toil?
    GUILDENSTERN
      340  O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
      341  unmannerly.
    HAMLET
      342  I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
      343  this pipe?
    GUILDENSTERN
      344  My lord, I cannot.
    HAMLET
      345  I pray you.
    GUILDENSTERN
      346  Believe me, I cannot.
    HAMLET
      347  I do beseech you.
    GUILDENSTERN
      348  I know no touch of it, my lord.
    HAMLET
      349  'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
      350  your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your
      351  mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
      352  Look you, these are the stops.
    GUILDENSTERN
      353  But these cannot I command to any utterance of
      354  harmony; I have not the skill.
    HAMLET
      355  Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
      356  me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
      357  my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
      358  mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
      359  the top of my compass: and there is much music,
      360  excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
      361  you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
      362  easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
      363  instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
      364  cannot play upon me.
  Direction: Enter POLONIUS
      365  God bless you, sir!
    LORD POLONIUS
      366  My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
      367  presently.
    HAMLET
      368  Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
    LORD POLONIUS
      369  By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
    HAMLET
      370  Methinks it is like a weasel.
    LORD POLONIUS
      371  It is backed like a weasel.
    HAMLET
      372  Or like a whale?
    LORD POLONIUS
      373  Very like a whale.
    HAMLET
      374  Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
      375  me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.
    LORD POLONIUS
      376  I will say so.
    HAMLET
      377  By and by is easily said.
  Direction: Exit POLONIUS
      378  Leave me, friends.
  Direction: Exeunt all but HAMLET
      379  Tis now the very witching time of night,
      380  When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
      381  Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
      382  And do such bitter business as the day
      383  Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
      384  O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
      385  The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
      386  Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
      387  I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
      388  My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
      389  How in my words soever she be shent,
      390  To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
  Direction: Exit
