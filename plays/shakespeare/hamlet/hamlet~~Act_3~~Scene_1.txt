          Hamlet : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A room in the castle.
  Direction: Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
    KING CLAUDIUS
        1  And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
        2  Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
        3  Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
        4  With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
    ROSENCRANTZ
        5  He does confess he feels himself distracted;
        6  But from what cause he will by no means speak.
    GUILDENSTERN
        7  Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
        8  But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
        9  When we would bring him on to some confession
       10  Of his true state.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       11  Did he receive you well?
    ROSENCRANTZ
       12  Most like a gentleman.
    GUILDENSTERN
       13  But with much forcing of his disposition.
    ROSENCRANTZ
       14  Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
       15  Most free in his reply.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       16  Did you assay him?
       17  To any pastime?
    ROSENCRANTZ
       18  Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
       19  We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
       20  And there did seem in him a kind of joy
       21  To hear of it: they are about the court,
       22  And, as I think, they have already order
       23  This night to play before him.
    LORD POLONIUS
       24  'Tis most true:
       25  And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
       26  To hear and see the matter.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       27  With all my heart; and it doth much content me
       28  To hear him so inclined.
       29  Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
       30  And drive his purpose on to these delights.
    ROSENCRANTZ
       31  We shall, my lord.
  Direction: Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    KING CLAUDIUS
       32  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
       33  For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
       34  That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
       35  Affront Ophelia:
       36  Her father and myself, lawful espials,
       37  Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
       38  We may of their encounter frankly judge,
       39  And gather by him, as he is behaved,
       40  If 't be the affliction of his love or no
       41  That thus he suffers for.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       42  I shall obey you.
       43  And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
       44  That your good beauties be the happy cause
       45  Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
       46  Will bring him to his wonted way again,
       47  To both your honours.
    OPHELIA
       48  Madam, I wish it may.
  Direction: Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE
    LORD POLONIUS
       49  Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
       50  We will bestow ourselves.
  Direction: To OPHELIA
       51  Read on this book;
       52  That show of such an exercise may colour
       53  Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
       54  'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
       55  And pious action we do sugar o'er
       56  The devil himself.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       57  [Aside] O, 'tis too true!
       58  How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
       59  The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
       60  Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
       61  Than is my deed to my most painted word:
       62  O heavy burthen!
    LORD POLONIUS
       63  I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
  Direction: Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS
  Direction: Enter HAMLET
    HAMLET
       64  To be, or not to be: that is the question:
       65  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
       66  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
       67  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
       68  And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
       69  No more; and by a sleep to say we end
       70  The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
       71  That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
       72  Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
       73  To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
       74  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
       75  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
       76  Must give us pause: there's the respect
       77  That makes calamity of so long life;
       78  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
       79  The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
       80  The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
       81  The insolence of office and the spurns
       82  That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
       83  When he himself might his quietus make
       84  With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
       85  To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
       86  But that the dread of something after death,
       87  The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
       88  No traveller returns, puzzles the will
       89  And makes us rather bear those ills we have
       90  Than fly to others that we know not of?
       91  Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
       92  And thus the native hue of resolution
       93  Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
       94  And enterprises of great pith and moment
       95  With this regard their currents turn awry,
       96  And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
       97  The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
       98  Be all my sins remember'd.
    OPHELIA
       99  Good my lord,
      100  How does your honour for this many a day?
    HAMLET
      101  I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
    OPHELIA
      102  My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
      103  That I have longed long to re-deliver;
      104  I pray you, now receive them.
    HAMLET
      105  No, not I;
      106  I never gave you aught.
    OPHELIA
      107  My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
      108  And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
      109  As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
      110  Take these again; for to the noble mind
      111  Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
      112  There, my lord.
    HAMLET
      113  Ha, ha! are you honest?
    OPHELIA
      114  My lord?
    HAMLET
      115  Are you fair?
    OPHELIA
      116  What means your lordship?
    HAMLET
      117  That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
      118  admit no discourse to your beauty.
    OPHELIA
      119  Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
      120  with honesty?
    HAMLET
      121  Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
      122  transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
      123  force of honesty can translate beauty into his
      124  likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
      125  time gives it proof. I did love you once.
    OPHELIA
      126  Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
    HAMLET
      127  You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
      128  so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
      129  it: I loved you not.
    OPHELIA
      130  I was the more deceived.
    HAMLET
      131  Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
      132  breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
      133  but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
      134  were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
      135  proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
      136  my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
      137  imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
      138  in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
      139  between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
      140  all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
      141  Where's your father?
    OPHELIA
      142  At home, my lord.
    HAMLET
      143  Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
      144  fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
    OPHELIA
      145  O, help him, you sweet heavens!
    HAMLET
      146  If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
      147  thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
      148  snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
      149  nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
      150  marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
      151  what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
      152  and quickly too. Farewell.
    OPHELIA
      153  O heavenly powers, restore him!
    HAMLET
      154  I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
      155  has given you one face, and you make yourselves
      156  another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
      157  nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
      158  your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
      159  made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
      160  those that are married already, all but one, shall
      161  live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
      162  nunnery, go.
  Direction: Exit
    OPHELIA
      163  O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
      164  The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
      165  The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
      166  The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
      167  The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
      168  And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
      169  That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
      170  Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
      171  Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
      172  That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
      173  Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
      174  To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
  Direction: Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS
    KING CLAUDIUS
      175  Love! his affections do not that way tend;
      176  Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
      177  Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
      178  O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
      179  And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
      180  Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
      181  I have in quick determination
      182  Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
      183  For the demand of our neglected tribute
      184  Haply the seas and countries different
      185  With variable objects shall expel
      186  This something-settled matter in his heart,
      187  Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
      188  From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
    LORD POLONIUS
      189  It shall do well: but yet do I believe
      190  The origin and commencement of his grief
      191  Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
      192  You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
      193  We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
      194  But, if you hold it fit, after the play
      195  Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
      196  To show his grief: let her be round with him;
      197  And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
      198  Of all their conference. If she find him not,
      199  To England send him, or confine him where
      200  Your wisdom best shall think.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      201  It shall be so:
      202  Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
  Direction: Exeunt
