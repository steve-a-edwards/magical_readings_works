          Hamlet : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
  Direction: FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
    BERNARDO
        1  Who's there?
    FRANCISCO
        2  Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
    BERNARDO
        3  Long live the king!
    FRANCISCO
        4  Bernardo?
    BERNARDO
        5  He.
    FRANCISCO
        6  You come most carefully upon your hour.
    BERNARDO
        7  'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
    FRANCISCO
        8  For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
        9  And I am sick at heart.
    BERNARDO
       10  Have you had quiet guard?
    FRANCISCO
       11  Not a mouse stirring.
    BERNARDO
       12  Well, good night.
       13  If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
       14  The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
    FRANCISCO
       15  I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
  Direction: Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
    HORATIO
       16  Friends to this ground.
    MARCELLUS
       17  And liegemen to the Dane.
    FRANCISCO
       18  Give you good night.
    MARCELLUS
       19  O, farewell, honest soldier:
       20  Who hath relieved you?
    FRANCISCO
       21  Bernardo has my place.
       22  Give you good night.
  Direction: Exit
    MARCELLUS
       23  Holla! Bernardo!
    BERNARDO
       24  Say,
       25  What, is Horatio there?
    HORATIO
       26  A piece of him.
    BERNARDO
       27  Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
    MARCELLUS
       28  What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
    BERNARDO
       29  I have seen nothing.
    MARCELLUS
       30  Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
       31  And will not let belief take hold of him
       32  Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
       33  Therefore I have entreated him along
       34  With us to watch the minutes of this night;
       35  That if again this apparition come,
       36  He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
    HORATIO
       37  Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
    BERNARDO
       38  Sit down awhile;
       39  And let us once again assail your ears,
       40  That are so fortified against our story
       41  What we have two nights seen.
    HORATIO
       42  Well, sit we down,
       43  And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
    BERNARDO
       44  Last night of all,
       45  When yond same star that's westward from the pole
       46  Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
       47  Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
       48  The bell then beating one,--
  Direction: Enter Ghost
    MARCELLUS
       49  Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
    BERNARDO
       50  In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
    MARCELLUS
       51  Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
    BERNARDO
       52  Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
    HORATIO
       53  Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
    BERNARDO
       54  It would be spoke to.
    MARCELLUS
       55  Question it, Horatio.
    HORATIO
       56  What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
       57  Together with that fair and warlike form
       58  In which the majesty of buried Denmark
       59  Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
    MARCELLUS
       60  It is offended.
    BERNARDO
       61  See, it stalks away!
    HORATIO
       62  Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
  Direction: Exit Ghost
    MARCELLUS
       63  'Tis gone, and will not answer.
    BERNARDO
       64  How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
       65  Is not this something more than fantasy?
       66  What think you on't?
    HORATIO
       67  Before my God, I might not this believe
       68  Without the sensible and true avouch
       69  Of mine own eyes.
    MARCELLUS
       70  Is it not like the king?
    HORATIO
       71  As thou art to thyself:
       72  Such was the very armour he had on
       73  When he the ambitious Norway combated;
       74  So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
       75  He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
       76  'Tis strange.
    MARCELLUS
       77  Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
       78  With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
    HORATIO
       79  In what particular thought to work I know not;
       80  But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
       81  This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
    MARCELLUS
       82  Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
       83  Why this same strict and most observant watch
       84  So nightly toils the subject of the land,
       85  And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
       86  And foreign mart for implements of war;
       87  Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
       88  Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
       89  What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
       90  Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
       91  Who is't that can inform me?
    HORATIO
       92  That can I;
       93  At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
       94  Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
       95  Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
       96  Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
       97  Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
       98  For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
       99  Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
      100  Well ratified by law and heraldry,
      101  Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
      102  Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
      103  Against the which, a moiety competent
      104  Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
      105  To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
      106  Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
      107  And carriage of the article design'd,
      108  His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
      109  Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
      110  Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
      111  Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
      112  For food and diet, to some enterprise
      113  That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
      114  As it doth well appear unto our state--
      115  But to recover of us, by strong hand
      116  And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
      117  So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
      118  Is the main motive of our preparations,
      119  The source of this our watch and the chief head
      120  Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
    BERNARDO
      121  I think it be no other but e'en so:
      122  Well may it sort that this portentous figure
      123  Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
      124  That was and is the question of these wars.
    HORATIO
      125  A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
      126  In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
      127  A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
      128  The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
      129  Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
      130  As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
      131  Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
      132  Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
      133  Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
      134  And even the like precurse of fierce events,
      135  As harbingers preceding still the fates
      136  And prologue to the omen coming on,
      137  Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
      138  Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
      139  But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
  Direction: Re-enter Ghost
      140  I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
      141  If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
      142  Speak to me:
      143  If there be any good thing to be done,
      144  That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
      145  Speak to me:
  Direction: Cock crows
      146  If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
      147  Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
      148  Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
      149  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
      150  For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
      151  Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
    MARCELLUS
      152  Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
    HORATIO
      153  Do, if it will not stand.
    BERNARDO
      154  'Tis here!
    HORATIO
      155  'Tis here!
    MARCELLUS
      156  'Tis gone!
  Direction: Exit Ghost
      157  We do it wrong, being so majestical,
      158  To offer it the show of violence;
      159  For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
      160  And our vain blows malicious mockery.
    BERNARDO
      161  It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
    HORATIO
      162  And then it started like a guilty thing
      163  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
      164  The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
      165  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
      166  Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
      167  Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
      168  The extravagant and erring spirit hies
      169  To his confine: and of the truth herein
      170  This present object made probation.
    MARCELLUS
      171  It faded on the crowing of the cock.
      172  Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
      173  Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
      174  The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
      175  And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
      176  The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
      177  No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
      178  So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
    HORATIO
      179  So have I heard and do in part believe it.
      180  But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
      181  Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
      182  Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
      183  Let us impart what we have seen to-night
      184  Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
      185  This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
      186  Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
      187  As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    MARCELLUS
      188  Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
      189  Where we shall find him most conveniently.
  Direction: Exeunt
