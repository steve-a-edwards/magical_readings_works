          Hamlet : Act 4 : Scene 7

SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.
  Direction: Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES
    KING CLAUDIUS
        1  Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
        2  And you must put me in your heart for friend,
        3  Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
        4  That he which hath your noble father slain
        5  Pursued my life.
    LAERTES
        6  It well appears: but tell me
        7  Why you proceeded not against these feats,
        8  So crimeful and so capital in nature,
        9  As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
       10  You mainly were stirr'd up.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       11  O, for two special reasons;
       12  Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
       13  But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
       14  Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
       15  My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
       16  She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
       17  That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
       18  I could not but by her. The other motive,
       19  Why to a public count I might not go,
       20  Is the great love the general gender bear him;
       21  Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
       22  Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
       23  Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
       24  Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
       25  Would have reverted to my bow again,
       26  And not where I had aim'd them.
    LAERTES
       27  And so have I a noble father lost;
       28  A sister driven into desperate terms,
       29  Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
       30  Stood challenger on mount of all the age
       31  For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       32  Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
       33  That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
       34  That we can let our beard be shook with danger
       35  And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
       36  I loved your father, and we love ourself;
       37  And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
       38  How now! what news?
    Messenger
       39  Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
       40  This to your majesty; this to the queen.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       41  From Hamlet! who brought them?
    Messenger
       42  Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
       43  They were given me by Claudio; he received them
       44  Of him that brought them.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       45  Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
  Direction: Exit Messenger
  Direction: Reads
       46  'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
       47  your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
       48  your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
       49  pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
       50  and more strange return. 'HAMLET.'
       51  What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
       52  Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
    LAERTES
       53  Know you the hand?
    KING CLAUDIUS
       54  'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
       55  And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
       56  Can you advise me?
    LAERTES
       57  I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
       58  It warms the very sickness in my heart,
       59  That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
       60  'Thus didest thou.'
    KING CLAUDIUS
       61  If it be so, Laertes--
       62  As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
       63  Will you be ruled by me?
    LAERTES
       64  Ay, my lord;
       65  So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       66  To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
       67  As checking at his voyage, and that he means
       68  No more to undertake it, I will work him
       69  To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
       70  Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
       71  And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
       72  But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
       73  And call it accident.
    LAERTES
       74  My lord, I will be ruled;
       75  The rather, if you could devise it so
       76  That I might be the organ.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       77  It falls right.
       78  You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
       79  And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
       80  Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
       81  Did not together pluck such envy from him
       82  As did that one, and that, in my regard,
       83  Of the unworthiest siege.
    LAERTES
       84  What part is that, my lord?
    KING CLAUDIUS
       85  A very riband in the cap of youth,
       86  Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
       87  The light and careless livery that it wears
       88  Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
       89  Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
       90  Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
       91  I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
       92  And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
       93  Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
       94  And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
       95  As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
       96  With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
       97  That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
       98  Come short of what he did.
    LAERTES
       99  A Norman was't?
    KING CLAUDIUS
      100  A Norman.
    LAERTES
      101  Upon my life, Lamond.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      102  The very same.
    LAERTES
      103  I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
      104  And gem of all the nation.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      105  He made confession of you,
      106  And gave you such a masterly report
      107  For art and exercise in your defence
      108  And for your rapier most especially,
      109  That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
      110  If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
      111  He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
      112  If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
      113  Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
      114  That he could nothing do but wish and beg
      115  Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
      116  Now, out of this,--
    LAERTES
      117  What out of this, my lord?
    KING CLAUDIUS
      118  Laertes, was your father dear to you?
      119  Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
      120  A face without a heart?
    LAERTES
      121  Why ask you this?
    KING CLAUDIUS
      122  Not that I think you did not love your father;
      123  But that I know love is begun by time;
      124  And that I see, in passages of proof,
      125  Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
      126  There lives within the very flame of love
      127  A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
      128  And nothing is at a like goodness still;
      129  For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
      130  Dies in his own too much: that we would do
      131  We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
      132  And hath abatements and delays as many
      133  As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
      134  And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
      135  That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
      136  Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
      137  To show yourself your father's son in deed
      138  More than in words?
    LAERTES
      139  To cut his throat i' the church.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      140  No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
      141  Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
      142  Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
      143  Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
      144  We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
      145  And set a double varnish on the fame
      146  The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
      147  And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
      148  Most generous and free from all contriving,
      149  Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
      150  Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
      151  A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
      152  Requite him for your father.
    LAERTES
      153  I will do't:
      154  And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
      155  I bought an unction of a mountebank,
      156  So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
      157  Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
      158  Collected from all simples that have virtue
      159  Under the moon, can save the thing from death
      160  That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
      161  With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
      162  It may be death.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      163  Let's further think of this;
      164  Weigh what convenience both of time and means
      165  May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
      166  And that our drift look through our bad performance,
      167  'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
      168  Should have a back or second, that might hold,
      169  If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
      170  We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
      171  When in your motion you are hot and dry--
      172  As make your bouts more violent to that end--
      173  And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
      174  A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
      175  If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
      176  Our purpose may hold there.
  Direction: Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE
      177  How now, sweet queen!
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      178  One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
      179  So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
    LAERTES
      180  Drown'd! O, where?
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      181  There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
      182  That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
      183  There with fantastic garlands did she come
      184  Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
      185  That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
      186  But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
      187  There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
      188  Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
      189  When down her weedy trophies and herself
      190  Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
      191  And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
      192  Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
      193  As one incapable of her own distress,
      194  Or like a creature native and indued
      195  Unto that element: but long it could not be
      196  Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
      197  Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
      198  To muddy death.
    LAERTES
      199  Alas, then, she is drown'd?
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      200  Drown'd, drown'd.
    LAERTES
      201  Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
      202  And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
      203  It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
      204  Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
      205  The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
      206  I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
      207  But that this folly douts it.
  Direction: Exit
    KING CLAUDIUS
      208  Let's follow, Gertrude:
      209  How much I had to do to calm his rage!
      210  Now fear I this will give it start again;
      211  Therefore let's follow.
  Direction: Exeunt
