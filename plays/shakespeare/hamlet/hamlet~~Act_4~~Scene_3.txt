          Hamlet : Act 4 : Scene 3

SCENE III. Another room in the castle.
  Direction: Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended
    KING CLAUDIUS
        1  I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
        2  How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
        3  Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
        4  He's loved of the distracted multitude,
        5  Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
        6  And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
        7  But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
        8  This sudden sending him away must seem
        9  Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
       10  By desperate appliance are relieved,
       11  Or not at all.
  Direction: Enter ROSENCRANTZ
       12  How now! what hath befall'n?
    ROSENCRANTZ
       13  Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
       14  We cannot get from him.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       15  But where is he?
    ROSENCRANTZ
       16  Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       17  Bring him before us.
    ROSENCRANTZ
       18  Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
  Direction: Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN
    KING CLAUDIUS
       19  Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
    HAMLET
       20  At supper.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       21  At supper! where?
    HAMLET
       22  Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
       23  convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
       24  worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
       25  creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
       26  maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
       27  variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
       28  that's the end.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       29  Alas, alas!
    HAMLET
       30  A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
       31  king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       32  What dost you mean by this?
    HAMLET
       33  Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
       34  progress through the guts of a beggar.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       35  Where is Polonius?
    HAMLET
       36  In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
       37  find him not there, seek him i' the other place
       38  yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
       39  this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
       40  stairs into the lobby.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       41  Go seek him there.
  Direction: To some Attendants
    HAMLET
       42  He will stay till ye come.
  Direction: Exeunt Attendants
    KING CLAUDIUS
       43  Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
       44  Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
       45  For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
       46  With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
       47  The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
       48  The associates tend, and every thing is bent
       49  For England.
    HAMLET
       50  For England!
    KING CLAUDIUS
       51  Ay, Hamlet.
    HAMLET
       52  Good.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       53  So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
    HAMLET
       54  I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
       55  England! Farewell, dear mother.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       56  Thy loving father, Hamlet.
    HAMLET
       57  My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
       58  and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
  Direction: Exit
    KING CLAUDIUS
       59  Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
       60  Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
       61  Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
       62  That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
  Direction: Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
       63  And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
       64  As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
       65  Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
       66  After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
       67  Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
       68  Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
       69  By letters congruing to that effect,
       70  The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
       71  For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
       72  And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
       73  Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
  Direction: Exit
