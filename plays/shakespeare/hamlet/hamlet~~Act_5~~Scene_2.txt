          Hamlet : Act 5 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.
  Direction: Enter HAMLET and HORATIO
    HAMLET
        1  So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
        2  You do remember all the circumstance?
    HORATIO
        3  Remember it, my lord?
    HAMLET
        4  Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
        5  That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
        6  Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
        7  And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
        8  Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
        9  When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
       10  There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
       11  Rough-hew them how we will,--
    HORATIO
       12  That is most certain.
    HAMLET
       13  Up from my cabin,
       14  My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
       15  Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
       16  Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
       17  To mine own room again; making so bold,
       18  My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
       19  Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
       20  O royal knavery!--an exact command,
       21  Larded with many several sorts of reasons
       22  Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
       23  With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
       24  That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
       25  No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
       26  My head should be struck off.
    HORATIO
       27  Is't possible?
    HAMLET
       28  Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
       29  But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
    HORATIO
       30  I beseech you.
    HAMLET
       31  Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
       32  Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
       33  They had begun the play--I sat me down,
       34  Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
       35  I once did hold it, as our statists do,
       36  A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
       37  How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
       38  It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
       39  The effect of what I wrote?
    HORATIO
       40  Ay, good my lord.
    HAMLET
       41  An earnest conjuration from the king,
       42  As England was his faithful tributary,
       43  As love between them like the palm might flourish,
       44  As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
       45  And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
       46  And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
       47  That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
       48  Without debatement further, more or less,
       49  He should the bearers put to sudden death,
       50  Not shriving-time allow'd.
    HORATIO
       51  How was this seal'd?
    HAMLET
       52  Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
       53  I had my father's signet in my purse,
       54  Which was the model of that Danish seal;
       55  Folded the writ up in form of the other,
       56  Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
       57  The changeling never known. Now, the next day
       58  Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
       59  Thou know'st already.
    HORATIO
       60  So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
    HAMLET
       61  Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
       62  They are not near my conscience; their defeat
       63  Does by their own insinuation grow:
       64  'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
       65  Between the pass and fell incensed points
       66  Of mighty opposites.
    HORATIO
       67  Why, what a king is this!
    HAMLET
       68  Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
       69  He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
       70  Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
       71  Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
       72  And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
       73  To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
       74  To let this canker of our nature come
       75  In further evil?
    HORATIO
       76  It must be shortly known to him from England
       77  What is the issue of the business there.
    HAMLET
       78  It will be short: the interim is mine;
       79  And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
       80  But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
       81  That to Laertes I forgot myself;
       82  For, by the image of my cause, I see
       83  The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
       84  But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
       85  Into a towering passion.
    HORATIO
       86  Peace! who comes here?
  Direction: Enter OSRIC
    OSRIC
       87  Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
    HAMLET
       88  I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
    HORATIO
       89  No, my good lord.
    HAMLET
       90  Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
       91  know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
       92  beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
       93  the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
       94  spacious in the possession of dirt.
    OSRIC
       95  Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
       96  should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
    HAMLET
       97  I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
       98  spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
    OSRIC
       99  I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
    HAMLET
      100  No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
      101  northerly.
    OSRIC
      102  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
    HAMLET
      103  But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
      104  complexion.
    OSRIC
      105  Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
      106  'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
      107  majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
      108  great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
    HAMLET
      109  I beseech you, remember--
  Direction: HAMLET moves him to put on his hat
    OSRIC
      110  Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
      111  Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
      112  me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
      113  differences, of very soft society and great showing:
      114  indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
      115  calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
      116  continent of what part a gentleman would see.
    HAMLET
      117  Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
      118  though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
      119  dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
      120  neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
      121  verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
      122  great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
      123  rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
      124  semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
      125  him, his umbrage, nothing more.
    OSRIC
      126  Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
    HAMLET
      127  The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
      128  in our more rawer breath?
    OSRIC
      129  Sir?
    HORATIO
      130  Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
      131  You will do't, sir, really.
    HAMLET
      132  What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
    OSRIC
      133  Of Laertes?
    HORATIO
      134  His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
    HAMLET
      135  Of him, sir.
    OSRIC
      136  I know you are not ignorant--
    HAMLET
      137  I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
      138  it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
    OSRIC
      139  You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
    HAMLET
      140  I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
      141  him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
      142  know himself.
    OSRIC
      143  I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
      144  laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
    HAMLET
      145  What's his weapon?
    OSRIC
      146  Rapier and dagger.
    HAMLET
      147  That's two of his weapons: but, well.
    OSRIC
      148  The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
      149  horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
      150  it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
      151  assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
      152  carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
      153  responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
      154  and of very liberal conceit.
    HAMLET
      155  What call you the carriages?
    HORATIO
      156  I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
    OSRIC
      157  The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
    HAMLET
      158  The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
      159  could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
      160  be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
      161  against six French swords, their assigns, and three
      162  liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
      163  against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
    OSRIC
      164  The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
      165  between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
      166  three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
      167  would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
      168  would vouchsafe the answer.
    HAMLET
      169  How if I answer 'no'?
    OSRIC
      170  I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
    HAMLET
      171  Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
      172  majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
      173  the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
      174  king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
      175  if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
    OSRIC
      176  Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
    HAMLET
      177  To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
    OSRIC
      178  I commend my duty to your lordship.
    HAMLET
      179  Yours, yours.
  Direction: Exit OSRIC
      180  He does well to commend it himself; there are no
      181  tongues else for's turn.
    HORATIO
      182  This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
    HAMLET
      183  He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
      184  Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
      185  know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
      186  the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
      187  yesty collection, which carries them through and
      188  through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
      189  but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
  Direction: Enter a Lord
    Lord
      190  My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
      191  Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
      192  the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
      193  play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
    HAMLET
      194  I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
      195  pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
      196  or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
    Lord
      197  The king and queen and all are coming down.
    HAMLET
      198  In happy time.
    Lord
      199  The queen desires you to use some gentle
      200  entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
    HAMLET
      201  She well instructs me.
  Direction: Exit Lord
    HORATIO
      202  You will lose this wager, my lord.
    HAMLET
      203  I do not think so: since he went into France, I
      204  have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
      205  odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
      206  about my heart: but it is no matter.
    HORATIO
      207  Nay, good my lord,--
    HAMLET
      208  It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
      209  gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
    HORATIO
      210  If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
      211  forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
      212  fit.
    HAMLET
      213  Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
      214  providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
      215  'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
      216  now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
      217  readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
      218  leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
  Direction: Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, and c
    KING CLAUDIUS
      219  Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
  Direction: KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's
    HAMLET
      220  Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
      221  But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
      222  This presence knows,
      223  And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
      224  With sore distraction. What I have done,
      225  That might your nature, honour and exception
      226  Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
      227  Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
      228  If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
      229  And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
      230  Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
      231  Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
      232  Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
      233  His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
      234  Sir, in this audience,
      235  Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
      236  Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
      237  That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
      238  And hurt my brother.
    LAERTES
      239  I am satisfied in nature,
      240  Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
      241  To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
      242  I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
      243  Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
      244  I have a voice and precedent of peace,
      245  To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
      246  I do receive your offer'd love like love,
      247  And will not wrong it.
    HAMLET
      248  I embrace it freely;
      249  And will this brother's wager frankly play.
      250  Give us the foils. Come on.
    LAERTES
      251  Come, one for me.
    HAMLET
      252  I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
      253  Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
      254  Stick fiery off indeed.
    LAERTES
      255  You mock me, sir.
    HAMLET
      256  No, by this hand.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      257  Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
      258  You know the wager?
    HAMLET
      259  Very well, my lord
      260  Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      261  I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
      262  But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
    LAERTES
      263  This is too heavy, let me see another.
    HAMLET
      264  This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
  Direction: They prepare to play
    OSRIC
      265  Ay, my good lord.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      266  Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
      267  If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
      268  Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
      269  Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
      270  The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
      271  And in the cup an union shall he throw,
      272  Richer than that which four successive kings
      273  In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
      274  And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
      275  The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
      276  The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
      277  'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
      278  And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
    HAMLET
      279  Come on, sir.
    LAERTES
      280  Come, my lord.
  Direction: They play
    HAMLET
      281  One.
    LAERTES
      282  No.
    HAMLET
      283  Judgment.
    OSRIC
      284  A hit, a very palpable hit.
    LAERTES
      285  Well; again.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      286  Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
      287  Here's to thy health.
  Direction: Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within
      288  Give him the cup.
    HAMLET
      289  I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
  Direction: They play
      290  Another hit; what say you?
    LAERTES
      291  A touch, a touch, I do confess.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      292  Our son shall win.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      293  He's fat, and scant of breath.
      294  Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
      295  The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
    HAMLET
      296  Good madam!
    KING CLAUDIUS
      297  Gertrude, do not drink.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      298  I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      299  [Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
    HAMLET
      300  I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      301  Come, let me wipe thy face.
    LAERTES
      302  My lord, I'll hit him now.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      303  I do not think't.
    LAERTES
      304  [Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
    HAMLET
      305  Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
      306  I pray you, pass with your best violence;
      307  I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
    LAERTES
      308  Say you so? come on.
  Direction: They play
    OSRIC
      309  Nothing, neither way.
    LAERTES
      310  Have at you now!
  Direction: LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES
    KING CLAUDIUS
      311  Part them; they are incensed.
    HAMLET
      312  Nay, come, again.
  Direction: QUEEN GERTRUDE falls
    OSRIC
      313  Look to the queen there, ho!
    HORATIO
      314  They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
    OSRIC
      315  How is't, Laertes?
    LAERTES
      316  Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
      317  I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
    HAMLET
      318  How does the queen?
    KING CLAUDIUS
      319  She swounds to see them bleed.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      320  No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
      321  The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
  Direction: Dies
    HAMLET
      322  O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
      323  Treachery! Seek it out.
    LAERTES
      324  It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
      325  No medicine in the world can do thee good;
      326  In thee there is not half an hour of life;
      327  The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
      328  Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
      329  Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
      330  Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
      331  I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
    HAMLET
      332  The point!--envenom'd too!
      333  Then, venom, to thy work.
  Direction: Stabs KING CLAUDIUS
    All
      334  Treason! treason!
    KING CLAUDIUS
      335  O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
    HAMLET
      336  Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
      337  Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
      338  Follow my mother.
  Direction: KING CLAUDIUS dies
    LAERTES
      339  He is justly served;
      340  It is a poison temper'd by himself.
      341  Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
      342  Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
      343  Nor thine on me.
  Direction: Dies
    HAMLET
      344  Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
      345  I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
      346  You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
      347  That are but mutes or audience to this act,
      348  Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
      349  Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
      350  But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
      351  Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
      352  To the unsatisfied.
    HORATIO
      353  Never believe it:
      354  I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
      355  Here's yet some liquor left.
    HAMLET
      356  As thou'rt a man,
      357  Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
      358  O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
      359  Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
      360  If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
      361  Absent thee from felicity awhile,
      362  And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
      363  To tell my story.
  Direction: March afar off, and shot within
      364  What warlike noise is this?
    OSRIC
      365  Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
      366  To the ambassadors of England gives
      367  This warlike volley.
    HAMLET
      368  O, I die, Horatio;
      369  The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
      370  I cannot live to hear the news from England;
      371  But I do prophesy the election lights
      372  On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
      373  So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
      374  Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
  Direction: Dies
    HORATIO
      375  Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
      376  And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
      377  Why does the drum come hither?
  Direction: March within
  Direction: Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others
    PRINCE FORTINBRAS
      378  Where is this sight?
    HORATIO
      379  What is it ye would see?
      380  If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
    PRINCE FORTINBRAS
      381  This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
      382  What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
      383  That thou so many princes at a shot
      384  So bloodily hast struck?
    First Ambassador
      385  The sight is dismal;
      386  And our affairs from England come too late:
      387  The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
      388  To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
      389  That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
      390  Where should we have our thanks?
    HORATIO
      391  Not from his mouth,
      392  Had it the ability of life to thank you:
      393  He never gave commandment for their death.
      394  But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
      395  You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
      396  Are here arrived give order that these bodies
      397  High on a stage be placed to the view;
      398  And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
      399  How these things came about: so shall you hear
      400  Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
      401  Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
      402  Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
      403  And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
      404  Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
      405  Truly deliver.
    PRINCE FORTINBRAS
      406  Let us haste to hear it,
      407  And call the noblest to the audience.
      408  For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
      409  I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
      410  Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
    HORATIO
      411  Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
      412  And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
      413  But let this same be presently perform'd,
      414  Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
      415  On plots and errors, happen.
    PRINCE FORTINBRAS
      416  Let four captains
      417  Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
      418  For he was likely, had he been put on,
      419  To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
      420  The soldiers' music and the rites of war
      421  Speak loudly for him.
      422  Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
      423  Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
      424  Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
  Direction: A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
