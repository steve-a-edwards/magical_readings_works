          Hamlet : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.
  Direction: Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO
    LORD POLONIUS
        1  Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
    REYNALDO
        2  I will, my lord.
    LORD POLONIUS
        3  You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
        4  Before you visit him, to make inquire
        5  Of his behavior.
    REYNALDO
        6  My lord, I did intend it.
    LORD POLONIUS
        7  Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
        8  Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
        9  And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
       10  What company, at what expense; and finding
       11  By this encompassment and drift of question
       12  That they do know my son, come you more nearer
       13  Than your particular demands will touch it:
       14  Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
       15  As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
       16  And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
    REYNALDO
       17  Ay, very well, my lord.
    LORD POLONIUS
       18  'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
       19  But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
       20  Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
       21  What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
       22  As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
       23  But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
       24  As are companions noted and most known
       25  To youth and liberty.
    REYNALDO
       26  As gaming, my lord.
    LORD POLONIUS
       27  Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
       28  Drabbing: you may go so far.
    REYNALDO
       29  My lord, that would dishonour him.
    LORD POLONIUS
       30  'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
       31  You must not put another scandal on him,
       32  That he is open to incontinency;
       33  That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
       34  That they may seem the taints of liberty,
       35  The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
       36  A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
       37  Of general assault.
    REYNALDO
       38  But, my good lord,--
    LORD POLONIUS
       39  Wherefore should you do this?
    REYNALDO
       40  Ay, my lord,
       41  I would know that.
    LORD POLONIUS
       42  Marry, sir, here's my drift;
       43  And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
       44  You laying these slight sullies on my son,
       45  As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
       46  Your party in converse, him you would sound,
       47  Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
       48  The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
       49  He closes with you in this consequence;
       50  'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
       51  According to the phrase or the addition
       52  Of man and country.
    REYNALDO
       53  Very good, my lord.
    LORD POLONIUS
       54  And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
       55  about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
       56  something: where did I leave?
    REYNALDO
       57  At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
       58  and 'gentleman.'
    LORD POLONIUS
       59  At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
       60  He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
       61  I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
       62  Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
       63  There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
       64  There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
       65  'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
       66  Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
       67  See you now;
       68  Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
       69  And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
       70  With windlasses and with assays of bias,
       71  By indirections find directions out:
       72  So by my former lecture and advice,
       73  Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
    REYNALDO
       74  My lord, I have.
    LORD POLONIUS
       75  God be wi' you; fare you well.
    REYNALDO
       76  Good my lord!
    LORD POLONIUS
       77  Observe his inclination in yourself.
    REYNALDO
       78  I shall, my lord.
    LORD POLONIUS
       79  And let him ply his music.
    REYNALDO
       80  Well, my lord.
    LORD POLONIUS
       81  Farewell!
  Direction: Exit REYNALDO
  Direction: Enter OPHELIA
       82  How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
    OPHELIA
       83  O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
    LORD POLONIUS
       84  With what, i' the name of God?
    OPHELIA
       85  My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
       86  Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
       87  No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
       88  Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
       89  Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
       90  And with a look so piteous in purport
       91  As if he had been loosed out of hell
       92  To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
    LORD POLONIUS
       93  Mad for thy love?
    OPHELIA
       94  My lord, I do not know;
       95  But truly, I do fear it.
    LORD POLONIUS
       96  What said he?
    OPHELIA
       97  He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
       98  Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
       99  And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
      100  He falls to such perusal of my face
      101  As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
      102  At last, a little shaking of mine arm
      103  And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
      104  He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
      105  As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
      106  And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
      107  And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
      108  He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
      109  For out o' doors he went without their helps,
      110  And, to the last, bended their light on me.
    LORD POLONIUS
      111  Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
      112  This is the very ecstasy of love,
      113  Whose violent property fordoes itself
      114  And leads the will to desperate undertakings
      115  As oft as any passion under heaven
      116  That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
      117  What, have you given him any hard words of late?
    OPHELIA
      118  No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
      119  I did repel his fetters and denied
      120  His access to me.
    LORD POLONIUS
      121  That hath made him mad.
      122  I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
      123  I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
      124  And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
      125  By heaven, it is as proper to our age
      126  To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
      127  As it is common for the younger sort
      128  To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
      129  This must be known; which, being kept close, might
      130  move
      131  More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
  Direction: Exeunt
