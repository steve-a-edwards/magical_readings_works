          Hamlet : Act 1 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
  Direction: Enter GHOST and HAMLET
    HAMLET
        1  Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
    Ghost
        2  Mark me.
    HAMLET
        3  I will.
    Ghost
        4  My hour is almost come,
        5  When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
        6  Must render up myself.
    HAMLET
        7  Alas, poor ghost!
    Ghost
        8  Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
        9  To what I shall unfold.
    HAMLET
       10  Speak; I am bound to hear.
    Ghost
       11  So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
    HAMLET
       12  What?
    Ghost
       13  I am thy father's spirit,
       14  Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
       15  And for the day confined to fast in fires,
       16  Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
       17  Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
       18  To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
       19  I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
       20  Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
       21  Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
       22  Thy knotted and combined locks to part
       23  And each particular hair to stand on end,
       24  Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
       25  But this eternal blazon must not be
       26  To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
       27  If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
    HAMLET
       28  O God!
    Ghost
       29  Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
    HAMLET
       30  Murder!
    Ghost
       31  Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
       32  But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
    HAMLET
       33  Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
       34  As meditation or the thoughts of love,
       35  May sweep to my revenge.
    Ghost
       36  I find thee apt;
       37  And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
       38  That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
       39  Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
       40  'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
       41  A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
       42  Is by a forged process of my death
       43  Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
       44  The serpent that did sting thy father's life
       45  Now wears his crown.
    HAMLET
       46  O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
    Ghost
       47  Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
       48  With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
       49  O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
       50  So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
       51  The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
       52  O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
       53  From me, whose love was of that dignity
       54  That it went hand in hand even with the vow
       55  I made to her in marriage, and to decline
       56  Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
       57  To those of mine!
       58  But virtue, as it never will be moved,
       59  Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
       60  So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
       61  Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
       62  And prey on garbage.
       63  But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
       64  Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
       65  My custom always of the afternoon,
       66  Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
       67  With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
       68  And in the porches of my ears did pour
       69  The leperous distilment; whose effect
       70  Holds such an enmity with blood of man
       71  That swift as quicksilver it courses through
       72  The natural gates and alleys of the body,
       73  And with a sudden vigour doth posset
       74  And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
       75  The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
       76  And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
       77  Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
       78  All my smooth body.
       79  Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
       80  Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
       81  Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
       82  Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
       83  No reckoning made, but sent to my account
       84  With all my imperfections on my head:
       85  O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
       86  If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
       87  Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
       88  A couch for luxury and damned incest.
       89  But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
       90  Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
       91  Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
       92  And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
       93  To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
       94  The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
       95  And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
       96  Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
  Direction: Exit
    HAMLET
       97  O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
       98  And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
       99  And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
      100  But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
      101  Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
      102  In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
      103  Yea, from the table of my memory
      104  I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
      105  All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
      106  That youth and observation copied there;
      107  And thy commandment all alone shall live
      108  Within the book and volume of my brain,
      109  Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
      110  O most pernicious woman!
      111  O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
      112  My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
      113  That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
      114  At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
  Direction: Writing
      115  So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
      116  It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
      117  I have sworn 't.
    MARCELLUS
    HORATIO
      118  [Within] My lord, my lord,--
    MARCELLUS
      119  [Within] Lord Hamlet,--
    HORATIO
      120  [Within] Heaven secure him!
    HAMLET
      121  So be it!
    HORATIO
      122  [Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
    HAMLET
      123  Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
  Direction: Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
    MARCELLUS
      124  How is't, my noble lord?
    HORATIO
      125  What news, my lord?
    HAMLET
      126  O, wonderful!
    HORATIO
      127  Good my lord, tell it.
    HAMLET
      128  No; you'll reveal it.
    HORATIO
      129  Not I, my lord, by heaven.
    MARCELLUS
      130  Nor I, my lord.
    HAMLET
      131  How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
      132  But you'll be secret?
    HORATIO
    MARCELLUS
      133  Ay, by heaven, my lord.
    HAMLET
      134  There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
      135  But he's an arrant knave.
    HORATIO
      136  There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
      137  To tell us this.
    HAMLET
      138  Why, right; you are i' the right;
      139  And so, without more circumstance at all,
      140  I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
      141  You, as your business and desire shall point you;
      142  For every man has business and desire,
      143  Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
      144  Look you, I'll go pray.
    HORATIO
      145  These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
    HAMLET
      146  I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
      147  Yes, 'faith heartily.
    HORATIO
      148  There's no offence, my lord.
    HAMLET
      149  Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
      150  And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
      151  It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
      152  For your desire to know what is between us,
      153  O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
      154  As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
      155  Give me one poor request.
    HORATIO
      156  What is't, my lord? we will.
    HAMLET
      157  Never make known what you have seen to-night.
    HORATIO
    MARCELLUS
      158  My lord, we will not.
    HAMLET
      159  Nay, but swear't.
    HORATIO
      160  In faith,
      161  My lord, not I.
    MARCELLUS
      162  Nor I, my lord, in faith.
    HAMLET
      163  Upon my sword.
    MARCELLUS
      164  We have sworn, my lord, already.
    HAMLET
      165  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
    Ghost
      166  [Beneath] Swear.
    HAMLET
      167  Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
      168  truepenny?
      169  Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
      170  Consent to swear.
    HORATIO
      171  Propose the oath, my lord.
    HAMLET
      172  Never to speak of this that you have seen,
      173  Swear by my sword.
    Ghost
      174  [Beneath] Swear.
    HAMLET
      175  Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
      176  Come hither, gentlemen,
      177  And lay your hands again upon my sword:
      178  Never to speak of this that you have heard,
      179  Swear by my sword.
    Ghost
      180  [Beneath] Swear.
    HAMLET
      181  Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
      182  A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
    HORATIO
      183  O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
    HAMLET
      184  And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
      185  There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
      186  Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
      187  Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
      188  How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
      189  As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
      190  To put an antic disposition on,
      191  That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
      192  With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
      193  Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
      194  As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
      195  Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
      196  Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
      197  That you know aught of me: this not to do,
      198  So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
    Ghost
      199  [Beneath] Swear.
    HAMLET
      200  Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
  Direction: They swear
      201  So, gentlemen,
      202  With all my love I do commend me to you:
      203  And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
      204  May do, to express his love and friending to you,
      205  God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
      206  And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
      207  The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
      208  That ever I was born to set it right!
      209  Nay, come, let's go together.
  Direction: Exeunt
