          Hamlet : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A churchyard.
  Direction: Enter two Clowns, with spades, and c
    First Clown
        1  Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
        2  wilfully seeks her own salvation?
    Second Clown
        3  I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
        4  straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
        5  Christian burial.
    First Clown
        6  How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
        7  own defence?
    Second Clown
        8  Why, 'tis found so.
    First Clown
        9  It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
       10  here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
       11  it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
       12  is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
       13  herself wittingly.
    Second Clown
       14  Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
    First Clown
       15  Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
       16  stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
       17  and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
       18  goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
       19  and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
       20  that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
    Second Clown
       21  But is this law?
    First Clown
       22  Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
    Second Clown
       23  Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
       24  a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
       25  Christian burial.
    First Clown
       26  Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
       27  great folk should have countenance in this world to
       28  drown or hang themselves, more than their even
       29  Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
       30  gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
       31  they hold up Adam's profession.
    Second Clown
       32  Was he a gentleman?
    First Clown
       33  He was the first that ever bore arms.
    Second Clown
       34  Why, he had none.
    First Clown
       35  What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
       36  Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
       37  could he dig without arms? I'll put another
       38  question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
       39  purpose, confess thyself--
    Second Clown
       40  Go to.
    First Clown
       41  What is he that builds stronger than either the
       42  mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
    Second Clown
       43  The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
       44  thousand tenants.
    First Clown
       45  I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
       46  does well; but how does it well? it does well to
       47  those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
       48  gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
       49  the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
    Second Clown
       50  'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
       51  a carpenter?'
    First Clown
       52  Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
    Second Clown
       53  Marry, now I can tell.
    First Clown
       54  To't.
    Second Clown
       55  Mass, I cannot tell.
  Direction: Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance
    First Clown
       56  Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
       57  ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
       58  you are asked this question next, say 'a
       59  grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
       60  doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
       61  stoup of liquor.
  Direction: Exit Second Clown
  Direction: He digs and sings
       62  In youth, when I did love, did love,
       63  Methought it was very sweet,
       64  To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
       65  O, methought, there was nothing meet.
    HAMLET
       66  Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
       67  sings at grave-making?
    HORATIO
       68  Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
    HAMLET
       69  'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
       70  the daintier sense.
    First Clown
       71  [Sings]
       72  But age, with his stealing steps,
       73  Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
       74  And hath shipped me intil the land,
       75  As if I had never been such.
  Direction: Throws up a skull
    HAMLET
       76  That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
       77  how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
       78  Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
       79  might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
       80  now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
       81  might it not?
    HORATIO
       82  It might, my lord.
    HAMLET
       83  Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
       84  sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
       85  be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
       86  such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
    HORATIO
       87  Ay, my lord.
    HAMLET
       88  Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
       89  knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
       90  here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
       91  see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
       92  but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
    First Clown
       93  [Sings]
       94  A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
       95  For and a shrouding sheet:
       96  O, a pit of clay for to be made
       97  For such a guest is meet.
  Direction: Throws up another skull
    HAMLET
       98  There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
       99  lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
      100  his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
      101  suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
      102  sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
      103  his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
      104  in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
      105  his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
      106  his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
      107  the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
      108  pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
      109  no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
      110  the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
      111  very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
      112  this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
    HORATIO
      113  Not a jot more, my lord.
    HAMLET
      114  Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
    HORATIO
      115  Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
    HAMLET
      116  They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
      117  in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
      118  grave's this, sirrah?
    First Clown
      119  Mine, sir.
  Direction: Sings
      120  O, a pit of clay for to be made
      121  For such a guest is meet.
    HAMLET
      122  I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
    First Clown
      123  You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
      124  yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
    HAMLET
      125  'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
      126  'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
    First Clown
      127  'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
      128  you.
    HAMLET
      129  What man dost thou dig it for?
    First Clown
      130  For no man, sir.
    HAMLET
      131  What woman, then?
    First Clown
      132  For none, neither.
    HAMLET
      133  Who is to be buried in't?
    First Clown
      134  One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
    HAMLET
      135  How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
      136  card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
      137  Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
      138  it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
      139  peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
      140  gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
      141  grave-maker?
    First Clown
      142  Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
      143  that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
    HAMLET
      144  How long is that since?
    First Clown
      145  Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
      146  was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
      147  is mad, and sent into England.
    HAMLET
      148  Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
    First Clown
      149  Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
      150  there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
    HAMLET
      151  Why?
    First Clown
      152  'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
      153  are as mad as he.
    HAMLET
      154  How came he mad?
    First Clown
      155  Very strangely, they say.
    HAMLET
      156  How strangely?
    First Clown
      157  Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
    HAMLET
      158  Upon what ground?
    First Clown
      159  Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
      160  and boy, thirty years.
    HAMLET
      161  How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
    First Clown
      162  I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
      163  have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
      164  hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
      165  or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
    HAMLET
      166  Why he more than another?
    First Clown
      167  Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
      168  he will keep out water a great while; and your water
      169  is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
      170  Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
      171  three and twenty years.
    HAMLET
      172  Whose was it?
    First Clown
      173  A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
    HAMLET
      174  Nay, I know not.
    First Clown
      175  A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
      176  flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
      177  sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
    HAMLET
      178  This?
    First Clown
      179  E'en that.
    HAMLET
      180  Let me see.
  Direction: Takes the skull
      181  Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
      182  of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
      183  borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
      184  abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
      185  it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
      186  not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
      187  gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
      188  that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
      189  now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
      190  Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
      191  her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
      192  come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
      193  me one thing.
    HORATIO
      194  What's that, my lord?
    HAMLET
      195  Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
      196  the earth?
    HORATIO
      197  E'en so.
    HAMLET
      198  And smelt so? pah!
  Direction: Puts down the skull
    HORATIO
      199  E'en so, my lord.
    HAMLET
      200  To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
      201  not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
      202  till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
    HORATIO
      203  'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
    HAMLET
      204  No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
      205  modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
      206  thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
      207  Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
      208  earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
      209  was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
      210  Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
      211  Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
      212  O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
      213  Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
      214  But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
  Direction: Enter Priest, and c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, and c
      215  The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
      216  And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
      217  The corse they follow did with desperate hand
      218  Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
      219  Couch we awhile, and mark.
  Direction: Retiring with HORATIO
    LAERTES
      220  What ceremony else?
    HAMLET
      221  That is Laertes,
      222  A very noble youth: mark.
    LAERTES
      223  What ceremony else?
    First Priest
      224  Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
      225  As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
      226  And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
      227  She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
      228  Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
      229  Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
      230  Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
      231  Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
      232  Of bell and burial.
    LAERTES
      233  Must there no more be done?
    First Priest
      234  No more be done:
      235  We should profane the service of the dead
      236  To sing a requiem and such rest to her
      237  As to peace-parted souls.
    LAERTES
      238  Lay her i' the earth:
      239  And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
      240  May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
      241  A ministering angel shall my sister be,
      242  When thou liest howling.
    HAMLET
      243  What, the fair Ophelia!
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      244  Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
  Direction: Scattering flowers
      245  I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
      246  I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
      247  And not have strew'd thy grave.
    LAERTES
      248  O, treble woe
      249  Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
      250  Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
      251  Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
      252  Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
  Direction: Leaps into the grave
      253  Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
      254  Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
      255  To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
      256  Of blue Olympus.
    HAMLET
      257  [Advancing] What is he whose grief
      258  Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
      259  Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
      260  Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
      261  Hamlet the Dane.
  Direction: Leaps into the grave
    LAERTES
      262  The devil take thy soul!
  Direction: Grappling with him
    HAMLET
      263  Thou pray'st not well.
      264  I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
      265  For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
      266  Yet have I something in me dangerous,
      267  Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      268  Pluck them asunder.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      269  Hamlet, Hamlet!
    All
      270  Gentlemen,--
    HORATIO
      271  Good my lord, be quiet.
  Direction: The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave
    HAMLET
      272  Why I will fight with him upon this theme
      273  Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      274  O my son, what theme?
    HAMLET
      275  I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
      276  Could not, with all their quantity of love,
      277  Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
    KING CLAUDIUS
      278  O, he is mad, Laertes.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      279  For love of God, forbear him.
    HAMLET
      280  'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
      281  Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
      282  Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
      283  I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
      284  To outface me with leaping in her grave?
      285  Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
      286  And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
      287  Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
      288  Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
      289  Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
      290  I'll rant as well as thou.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      291  This is mere madness:
      292  And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
      293  Anon, as patient as the female dove,
      294  When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
      295  His silence will sit drooping.
    HAMLET
      296  Hear you, sir;
      297  What is the reason that you use me thus?
      298  I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
      299  Let Hercules himself do what he may,
      300  The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
  Direction: Exit
    KING CLAUDIUS
      301  I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
  Direction: Exit HORATIO
  Direction: To LAERTES
      302  Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
      303  We'll put the matter to the present push.
      304  Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
      305  This grave shall have a living monument:
      306  An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
      307  Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
  Direction: Exeunt
