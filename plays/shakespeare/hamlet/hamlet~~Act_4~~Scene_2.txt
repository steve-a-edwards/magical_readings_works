          Hamlet : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Another room in the castle.
  Direction: Enter HAMLET
    HAMLET
        1  Safely stowed.
    ROSENCRANTZ:
    GUILDENSTERN:
        2  [Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
    HAMLET
        3  What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
        4  O, here they come.
  Direction: Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    ROSENCRANTZ
        5  What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
    HAMLET
        6  Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
    ROSENCRANTZ
        7  Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
        8  And bear it to the chapel.
    HAMLET
        9  Do not believe it.
    ROSENCRANTZ
       10  Believe what?
    HAMLET
       11  That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
       12  Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
       13  replication should be made by the son of a king?
    ROSENCRANTZ
       14  Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
    HAMLET
       15  Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
       16  rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
       17  king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
       18  an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
       19  be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
       20  gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
       21  shall be dry again.
    ROSENCRANTZ
       22  I understand you not, my lord.
    HAMLET
       23  I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
       24  foolish ear.
    ROSENCRANTZ
       25  My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
       26  with us to the king.
    HAMLET
       27  The body is with the king, but the king is not with
       28  the body. The king is a thing--
    GUILDENSTERN
       29  A thing, my lord!
    HAMLET
       30  Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
  Direction: Exeunt
