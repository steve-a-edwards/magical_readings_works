          Hamlet : Act 4 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.
  Direction: Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
        1  I will not speak with her.
    Gentleman
        2  She is importunate, indeed distract:
        3  Her mood will needs be pitied.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
        4  What would she have?
    Gentleman
        5  She speaks much of her father; says she hears
        6  There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
        7  Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
        8  That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
        9  Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
       10  The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
       11  And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
       12  Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
       13  yield them,
       14  Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
       15  Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
    HORATIO
       16  'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
       17  Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       18  Let her come in.
  Direction: Exit HORATIO
       19  To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
       20  Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
       21  So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
       22  It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
  Direction: Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA
    OPHELIA
       23  Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       24  How now, Ophelia!
    OPHELIA
       25  [Sings]
       26  How should I your true love know
       27  From another one?
       28  By his cockle hat and staff,
       29  And his sandal shoon.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       30  Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
    OPHELIA
       31  Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
  Direction: Sings
       32  He is dead and gone, lady,
       33  He is dead and gone;
       34  At his head a grass-green turf,
       35  At his heels a stone.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       36  Nay, but, Ophelia,--
    OPHELIA
       37  Pray you, mark.
  Direction: Sings
       38  White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
  Direction: Enter KING CLAUDIUS
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       39  Alas, look here, my lord.
    OPHELIA
       40  [Sings]
       41  Larded with sweet flowers
       42  Which bewept to the grave did go
       43  With true-love showers.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       44  How do you, pretty lady?
    OPHELIA
       45  Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
       46  daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
       47  what we may be. God be at your table!
    KING CLAUDIUS
       48  Conceit upon her father.
    OPHELIA
       49  Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
       50  ask you what it means, say you this:
  Direction: Sings
       51  To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
       52  All in the morning betime,
       53  And I a maid at your window,
       54  To be your Valentine.
       55  Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
       56  And dupp'd the chamber-door;
       57  Let in the maid, that out a maid
       58  Never departed more.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       59  Pretty Ophelia!
    OPHELIA
       60  Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
  Direction: Sings
       61  By Gis and by Saint Charity,
       62  Alack, and fie for shame!
       63  Young men will do't, if they come to't;
       64  By cock, they are to blame.
       65  Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
       66  You promised me to wed.
       67  So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
       68  An thou hadst not come to my bed.
    KING CLAUDIUS
       69  How long hath she been thus?
    OPHELIA
       70  I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
       71  cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
       72  i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
       73  and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
       74  coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
       75  good night, good night.
  Direction: Exit
    KING CLAUDIUS
       76  Follow her close; give her good watch,
       77  I pray you.
  Direction: Exit HORATIO
       78  O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
       79  All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
       80  When sorrows come, they come not single spies
       81  But in battalions. First, her father slain:
       82  Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
       83  Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
       84  Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
       85  For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
       86  In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
       87  Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
       88  Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
       89  Last, and as much containing as all these,
       90  Her brother is in secret come from France;
       91  Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
       92  And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
       93  With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
       94  Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
       95  Will nothing stick our person to arraign
       96  In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
       97  Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
       98  Gives me superfluous death.
  Direction: A noise within
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
       99  Alack, what noise is this?
    KING CLAUDIUS
      100  Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
  Direction: Enter another Gentleman
      101  What is the matter?
    Gentleman
      102  Save yourself, my lord:
      103  The ocean, overpeering of his list,
      104  Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
      105  Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
      106  O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
      107  And, as the world were now but to begin,
      108  Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
      109  The ratifiers and props of every word,
      110  They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
      111  Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
      112  'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      113  How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
      114  O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
    KING CLAUDIUS
      115  The doors are broke.
  Direction: Noise within
  Direction: Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following
    LAERTES
      116  Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
    Danes
      117  No, let's come in.
    LAERTES
      118  I pray you, give me leave.
    Danes
      119  We will, we will.
  Direction: They retire without the door
    LAERTES
      120  I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
      121  Give me my father!
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      122  Calmly, good Laertes.
    LAERTES
      123  That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
      124  Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
      125  Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
      126  Of my true mother.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      127  What is the cause, Laertes,
      128  That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
      129  Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
      130  There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
      131  That treason can but peep to what it would,
      132  Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
      133  Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
      134  Speak, man.
    LAERTES
      135  Where is my father?
    KING CLAUDIUS
      136  Dead.
    QUEEN GERTRUDE
      137  But not by him.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      138  Let him demand his fill.
    LAERTES
      139  How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
      140  To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
      141  Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
      142  I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
      143  That both the worlds I give to negligence,
      144  Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
      145  Most thoroughly for my father.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      146  Who shall stay you?
    LAERTES
      147  My will, not all the world:
      148  And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
      149  They shall go far with little.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      150  Good Laertes,
      151  If you desire to know the certainty
      152  Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
      153  That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
      154  Winner and loser?
    LAERTES
      155  None but his enemies.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      156  Will you know them then?
    LAERTES
      157  To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
      158  And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
      159  Repast them with my blood.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      160  Why, now you speak
      161  Like a good child and a true gentleman.
      162  That I am guiltless of your father's death,
      163  And am most sensible in grief for it,
      164  It shall as level to your judgment pierce
      165  As day does to your eye.
    Danes
      166  [Within] Let her come in.
    LAERTES
      167  How now! what noise is that?
  Direction: Re-enter OPHELIA
      168  O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
      169  Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
      170  By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
      171  Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
      172  Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
      173  O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
      174  Should be as moral as an old man's life?
      175  Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
      176  It sends some precious instance of itself
      177  After the thing it loves.
    OPHELIA
      178  [Sings]
      179  They bore him barefaced on the bier;
      180  Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
      181  And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
      182  Fare you well, my dove!
    LAERTES
      183  Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
      184  It could not move thus.
    OPHELIA
      185  [Sings]
      186  You must sing a-down a-down,
      187  An you call him a-down-a.
      188  O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
      189  steward, that stole his master's daughter.
    LAERTES
      190  This nothing's more than matter.
    OPHELIA
      191  There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
      192  love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
    LAERTES
      193  A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
    OPHELIA
      194  There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
      195  for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
      196  herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
      197  a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
      198  some violets, but they withered all when my father
      199  died: they say he made a good end,--
  Direction: Sings
      200  For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
    LAERTES
      201  Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
      202  She turns to favour and to prettiness.
    OPHELIA
      203  [Sings]
      204  And will he not come again?
      205  And will he not come again?
      206  No, no, he is dead:
      207  Go to thy death-bed:
      208  He never will come again.
      209  His beard was as white as snow,
      210  All flaxen was his poll:
      211  He is gone, he is gone,
      212  And we cast away moan:
      213  God ha' mercy on his soul!
      214  And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
  Direction: Exit
    LAERTES
      215  Do you see this, O God?
    KING CLAUDIUS
      216  Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
      217  Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
      218  Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
      219  And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
      220  If by direct or by collateral hand
      221  They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
      222  Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
      223  To you in satisfaction; but if not,
      224  Be you content to lend your patience to us,
      225  And we shall jointly labour with your soul
      226  To give it due content.
    LAERTES
      227  Let this be so;
      228  His means of death, his obscure funeral--
      229  No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
      230  No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
      231  Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
      232  That I must call't in question.
    KING CLAUDIUS
      233  So you shall;
      234  And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
      235  I pray you, go with me.
  Direction: Exeunt
