          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. LEONATO'S garden.
  Direction: Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA
    HERO
        1  Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;
        2  There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
        3  Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
        4  Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
        5  Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
        6  Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
        7  And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
        8  Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
        9  Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,
       10  Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
       11  Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
       12  To listen our purpose. This is thy office;
       13  Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
    MARGARET
       14  I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
  Direction: Exit
    HERO
       15  Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
       16  As we do trace this alley up and down,
       17  Our talk must only be of Benedick.
       18  When I do name him, let it be thy part
       19  To praise him more than ever man did merit:
       20  My talk to thee must be how Benedick
       21  Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
       22  Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
       23  That only wounds by hearsay.
  Direction: Enter BEATRICE, behind
       24  Now begin;
       25  For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
       26  Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
    URSULA
       27  The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
       28  Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
       29  And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
       30  So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
       31  Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
       32  Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
    HERO
       33  Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
       34  Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
  Direction: Approaching the bower
       35  No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
       36  I know her spirits are as coy and wild
       37  As haggerds of the rock.
    URSULA
       38  But are you sure
       39  That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
    HERO
       40  So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
    URSULA
       41  And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
    HERO
       42  They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
       43  But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
       44  To wish him wrestle with affection,
       45  And never to let Beatrice know of it.
    URSULA
       46  Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
       47  Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
       48  As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
    HERO
       49  O god of love! I know he doth deserve
       50  As much as may be yielded to a man:
       51  But Nature never framed a woman's heart
       52  Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
       53  Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
       54  Misprising what they look on, and her wit
       55  Values itself so highly that to her
       56  All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
       57  Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
       58  She is so self-endeared.
    URSULA
       59  Sure, I think so;
       60  And therefore certainly it were not good
       61  She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
    HERO
       62  Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
       63  How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
       64  But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
       65  She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
       66  If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
       67  Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
       68  If low, an agate very vilely cut;
       69  If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
       70  If silent, why, a block moved with none.
       71  So turns she every man the wrong side out
       72  And never gives to truth and virtue that
       73  Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
    URSULA
       74  Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
    HERO
       75  No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
       76  As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
       77  But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
       78  She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
       79  Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
       80  Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
       81  Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
       82  It were a better death than die with mocks,
       83  Which is as bad as die with tickling.
    URSULA
       84  Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
    HERO
       85  No; rather I will go to Benedick
       86  And counsel him to fight against his passion.
       87  And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
       88  To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
       89  How much an ill word may empoison liking.
    URSULA
       90  O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
       91  She cannot be so much without true judgment--
       92  Having so swift and excellent a wit
       93  As she is prized to have--as to refuse
       94  So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
    HERO
       95  He is the only man of Italy.
       96  Always excepted my dear Claudio.
    URSULA
       97  I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
       98  Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
       99  For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
      100  Goes foremost in report through Italy.
    HERO
      101  Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
    URSULA
      102  His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
      103  When are you married, madam?
    HERO
      104  Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
      105  I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
      106  Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.
    URSULA
      107  She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.
    HERO
      108  If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
      109  Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
  Direction: Exeunt HERO and URSULA
    BEATRICE
      110  [Coming forward]
      111  What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
      112  Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
      113  Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
      114  No glory lives behind the back of such.
      115  And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
      116  Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
      117  If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
      118  To bind our loves up in a holy band;
      119  For others say thou dost deserve, and I
      120  Believe it better than reportingly.
  Direction: Exit
