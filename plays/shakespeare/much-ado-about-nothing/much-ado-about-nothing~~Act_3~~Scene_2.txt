          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 3 : Scene 2

_SCENE II. A room in LEONATO'S house
  Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO
    DON PEDRO
        1  I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and
        2  then go I toward Arragon.
    CLAUDIO
        3  I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll
        4  vouchsafe me.
    DON PEDRO
        5  Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
        6  of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
        7  and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
        8  with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown
        9  of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
       10  mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
       11  bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
       12  him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
       13  tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
       14  tongue speaks.
    BENEDICK
       15  Gallants, I am not as I have been.
    LEONATO
       16  So say I	methinks you are sadder.
    CLAUDIO
       17  I hope he be in love.
    DON PEDRO
       18  Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in
       19  him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
       20  he wants money.
    BENEDICK
       21  I have the toothache.
    DON PEDRO
       22  Draw it.
    BENEDICK
       23  Hang it!
    CLAUDIO
       24  You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
    DON PEDRO
       25  What! sigh for the toothache?
    LEONATO
       26  Where is but a humour or a worm.
    BENEDICK
       27  Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
       28  it.
    CLAUDIO
       29  Yet say I, he is in love.
    DON PEDRO
       30  There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
       31  a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
       32  a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
       33  shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
       34  the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
       35  the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
       36  to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
       37  fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
    CLAUDIO
       38  If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
       39  believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
       40  mornings; what should that bode?
    DON PEDRO
       41  Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
    CLAUDIO
       42  No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
       43  and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
       44  stuffed tennis-balls.
    LEONATO
       45  Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
    DON PEDRO
       46  Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
       47  out by that?
    CLAUDIO
       48  That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
    DON PEDRO
       49  The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
    CLAUDIO
       50  And when was he wont to wash his face?
    DON PEDRO
       51  Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
       52  what they say of him.
    CLAUDIO
       53  Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into
       54  a lute-string and now governed by stops.
    DON PEDRO
       55  Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
       56  conclude he is in love.
    CLAUDIO
       57  Nay, but I know who loves him.
    DON PEDRO
       58  That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.
    CLAUDIO
       59  Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
       60  all, dies for him.
    DON PEDRO
       61  She shall be buried with her face upwards.
    BENEDICK
       62  Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
       63  signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
       64  or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
       65  hobby-horses must not hear.
  Direction: Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO
    DON PEDRO
       66  For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.
    CLAUDIO
       67  'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this
       68  played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two
       69  bears will not bite one another when they meet.
  Direction: Enter DON JOHN
    DON JOHN
       70  My lord and brother, God save you!
    DON PEDRO
       71  Good den, brother.
    DON JOHN
       72  If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
    DON PEDRO
       73  In private?
    DON JOHN
       74  If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for
       75  what I would speak of concerns him.
    DON PEDRO
       76  What's the matter?
    DON JOHN
  Direction: To CLAUDIO
       77  Means your lordship to be married
       78  to-morrow?
    DON PEDRO
       79  You know he does.
    DON JOHN
       80  I know not that, when he knows what I know.
    CLAUDIO
       81  If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
    DON JOHN
       82  You may think I love you not: let that appear
       83  hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will
       84  manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you
       85  well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
       86  your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and
       87  labour ill bestowed.
    DON PEDRO
       88  Why, what's the matter?
    DON JOHN
       89  I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
       90  shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,
       91  the lady is disloyal.
    CLAUDIO
       92  Who, Hero?
    DON PEDRO
       93  Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:
    CLAUDIO
       94  Disloyal?
    DON JOHN
       95  The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I
       96  could say she were worse: think you of a worse
       97  title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
       98  further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
       99  see her chamber-window entered, even the night
      100  before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
      101  to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
      102  to change your mind.
    CLAUDIO
      103  May this be so?
    DON PEDRO
      104  I will not think it.
    DON JOHN
      105  If you dare not trust that you see, confess not
      106  that you know: if you will follow me, I will show
      107  you enough; and when you have seen more and heard
      108  more, proceed accordingly.
    CLAUDIO
      109  If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
      110  her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
      111  wed, there will I shame her.
    DON PEDRO
      112  And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join
      113  with thee to disgrace her.
    DON JOHN
      114  I will disparage her no farther till you are my
      115  witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and
      116  let the issue show itself.
    DON PEDRO
      117  O day untowardly turned!
    CLAUDIO
      118  O mischief strangely thwarting!
    DON JOHN
      119  O plague right well prevented! so will you say when
      120  you have seen the sequel.
  Direction: Exeunt
