          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 5 : Scene 3

SCENE III. A church.
  Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four with tapers
    CLAUDIO
        1  Is this the monument of Leonato?
        2  Lord
        3  It is, my lord.
    CLAUDIO
  Direction: Reading out of a scroll
        4  Done to death by slanderous tongues
        5  Was the Hero that here lies:
        6  Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
        7  Gives her fame which never dies.
        8  So the life that died with shame
        9  Lives in death with glorious fame.
       10  Hang thou there upon the tomb,
       11  Praising her when I am dumb.
       12  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
  Direction: SONG.
       13  Pardon, goddess of the night,
       14  Those that slew thy virgin knight;
       15  For the which, with songs of woe,
       16  Round about her tomb they go.
       17  Midnight, assist our moan;
       18  Help us to sigh and groan,
       19  Heavily, heavily:
       20  Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
       21  Till death be uttered,
       22  Heavily, heavily.
    CLAUDIO
       23  Now, unto thy bones good night!
       24  Yearly will I do this rite.
    DON PEDRO
       25  Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
       26  The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
       27  Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
       28  Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
       29  Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.
    CLAUDIO
       30  Good morrow, masters: each his several way.
    DON PEDRO
       31  Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
       32  And then to Leonato's we will go.
    CLAUDIO
       33  And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
       34  Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.
  Direction: Exeunt
