          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 5 : Scene 3

SCENE III. A church.
  Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four with tapers
    CLAUDIO
        1  Is this the monument of Leonato?
    Lord
        2  It is, my lord.
    CLAUDIO
        3  [Reading out of a scroll]
        4  Done to death by slanderous tongues
        5  Was the Hero that here lies:
        6  Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
        7  Gives her fame which never dies.
        8  So the life that died with shame
        9  Lives in death with glorious fame.
       10  Hang thou there upon the tomb,
       11  Praising her when I am dumb.
       12  Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
       13  SONG.
       14  Pardon, goddess of the night,
       15  Those that slew thy virgin knight;
       16  For the which, with songs of woe,
       17  Round about her tomb they go.
       18  Midnight, assist our moan;
       19  Help us to sigh and groan,
       20  Heavily, heavily:
       21  Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
       22  Till death be uttered,
       23  Heavily, heavily.
    CLAUDIO
       24  Now, unto thy bones good night!
       25  Yearly will I do this rite.
    DON PEDRO
       26  Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
       27  The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
       28  Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
       29  Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
       30  Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.
    CLAUDIO
       31  Good morrow, masters: each his several way.
    DON PEDRO
       32  Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
       33  And then to Leonato's we will go.
    CLAUDIO
       34  And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
       35  Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.
  Direction: Exeunt
