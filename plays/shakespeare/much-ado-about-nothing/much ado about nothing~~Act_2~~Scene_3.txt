          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 2 : Scene 3

SCENE III. LEONATO'S orchard.
  Direction: Enter BENEDICK
    BENEDICK
        1  Boy!
  Direction: Enter Boy
    Boy
        2  Signior?
    BENEDICK
        3  In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither
        4  to me in the orchard.
    Boy
        5  I am here already, sir.
    BENEDICK
        6  I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.
  Direction: Exit Boy
        7  I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
        8  another man is a fool when he dedicates his
        9  behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
       10  such shallow follies in others, become the argument
       11  of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
       12  is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
       13  with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
       14  rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
       15  when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
       16  good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
       17  carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
       18  speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
       19  and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
       20  words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
       21  strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
       22  these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
       23  be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
       24  I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
       25  of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
       26  is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
       27  well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
       28  graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
       29  my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
       30  or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;
       31  fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not
       32  near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
       33  discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
       34  be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
       35  Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.
  Direction: Withdraws
  Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO
    DON PEDRO
       36  Come, shall we hear this music?
    CLAUDIO
       37  Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
       38  As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!
    DON PEDRO
       39  See you where Benedick hath hid himself?
    CLAUDIO
       40  O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
       41  We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.
  Direction: Enter BALTHASAR with Music
    DON PEDRO
       42  Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
    BALTHASAR
       43  O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
       44  To slander music any more than once.
    DON PEDRO
       45  It is the witness still of excellency
       46  To put a strange face on his own perfection.
       47  I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
    BALTHASAR
       48  Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
       49  Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
       50  To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
       51  Yet will he swear he loves.
    DON PEDRO
       52  Now, pray thee, come;
       53  Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
       54  Do it in notes.
    BALTHASAR
       55  Note this before my notes;
       56  There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
    DON PEDRO
       57  Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
       58  Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.
  Direction: Air
    BENEDICK
       59  Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it
       60  not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out
       61  of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when
       62  all's done.
  Direction: The Song
    BALTHASAR
       63  Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
       64  Men were deceivers ever,
       65  One foot in sea and one on shore,
       66  To one thing constant never:
       67  Then sigh not so, but let them go,
       68  And be you blithe and bonny,
       69  Converting all your sounds of woe
       70  Into Hey nonny, nonny.
       71  Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
       72  Of dumps so dull and heavy;
       73  The fraud of men was ever so,
       74  Since summer first was leafy:
       75  Then sigh not so, & c.
    DON PEDRO
       76  By my troth, a good song.
    BALTHASAR
       77  And an ill singer, my lord.
    DON PEDRO
       78  Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.
    BENEDICK
       79  An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,
       80  they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad
       81  voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the
       82  night-raven, come what plague could have come after
       83  it.
    DON PEDRO
       84  Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,
       85  get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we
       86  would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.
    BALTHASAR
       87  The best I can, my lord.
    DON PEDRO
       88  Do so: farewell.
  Direction: Exit BALTHASAR
       89  Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of
       90  to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with
       91  Signior Benedick?
    CLAUDIO
       92  O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did
       93  never think that lady would have loved any man.
    LEONATO
       94  No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she
       95  should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in
       96  all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
    BENEDICK
       97  Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
    LEONATO
       98  By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think
       99  of it but that she loves him with an enraged
      100  affection: it is past the infinite of thought.
    DON PEDRO
      101  May be she doth but counterfeit.
    CLAUDIO
      102  Faith, like enough.
    LEONATO
      103  O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of
      104  passion came so near the life of passion as she
      105  discovers it.
    DON PEDRO
      106  Why, what effects of passion shows she?
    CLAUDIO
      107  Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
    LEONATO
      108  What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard
      109  my daughter tell you how.
    CLAUDIO
      110  She did, indeed.
    DON PEDRO
      111  How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
      112  thought her spirit had been invincible against all
      113  assaults of affection.
    LEONATO
      114  I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially
      115  against Benedick.
    BENEDICK
      116  I should think this a gull, but that the
      117  white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
      118  sure, hide himself in such reverence.
    CLAUDIO
      119  He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.
    DON PEDRO
      120  Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
    LEONATO
      121  No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.
    CLAUDIO
      122  'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
      123  I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
      124  with scorn, write to him that I love him?'
    LEONATO
      125  This says she now when she is beginning to write to
      126  him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
      127  there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
      128  sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
    CLAUDIO
      129  Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
      130  pretty jest your daughter told us of.
    LEONATO
      131  O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
      132  found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
    CLAUDIO
      133  That.
    LEONATO
      134  O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;
      135  railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
      136  to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
      137  measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I
      138  should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
      139  love him, I should.'
    CLAUDIO
      140  Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
      141  beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
      142  sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'
    LEONATO
      143  She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
      144  ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
      145  is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
      146  to herself: it is very true.
    DON PEDRO
      147  It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
      148  other, if she will not discover it.
    CLAUDIO
      149  To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
      150  torment the poor lady worse.
    DON PEDRO
      151  An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
      152  excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
      153  she is virtuous.
    CLAUDIO
      154  And she is exceeding wise.
    DON PEDRO
      155  In every thing but in loving Benedick.
    LEONATO
      156  O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender
      157  a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
      158  the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
      159  cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
    DON PEDRO
      160  I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
      161  have daffed all other respects and made her half
      162  myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
      163  what a' will say.
    LEONATO
      164  Were it good, think you?
    CLAUDIO
      165  Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
      166  will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
      167  she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
      168  her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
      169  accustomed crossness.
    DON PEDRO
      170  She doth well: if she should make tender of her
      171  love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
      172  man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
    CLAUDIO
      173  He is a very proper man.
    DON PEDRO
      174  He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
    CLAUDIO
      175  Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.
    DON PEDRO
      176  He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
    CLAUDIO
      177  And I take him to be valiant.
    DON PEDRO
      178  As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
      179  quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
      180  avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
      181  them with a most Christian-like fear.
    LEONATO
      182  If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:
      183  if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
      184  quarrel with fear and trembling.
    DON PEDRO
      185  And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
      186  howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
      187  he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
      188  we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?
    CLAUDIO
      189  Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
      190  good counsel.
    LEONATO
      191  Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
    DON PEDRO
      192  Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:
      193  let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
      194  could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
      195  how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
    LEONATO
      196  My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.
    CLAUDIO
      197  If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
      198  trust my expectation.
    DON PEDRO
      199  Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
      200  must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
      201  sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
      202  another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
      203  scene that I would see, which will be merely a
      204  dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.
  Direction: Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO
    BENEDICK
  Direction: Coming forward
      205  This can be no trick: the
      206  conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
      207  this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
      208  seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
      209  why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
      210  they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
      211  the love come from her; they say too that she will
      212  rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
      213  never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
      214  are they that hear their detractions and can put
      215  them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
      216  truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
      217  so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
      218  me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
      219  no great argument of her folly, for I will be
      220  horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
      221  odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
      222  because I have railed so long against marriage: but
      223  doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
      224  in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
      225  Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
      226  the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
      227  No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
      228  die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
      229  were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
      230  she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
      231  her.
  Direction: Enter BEATRICE
    BEATRICE
      232  Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
    BENEDICK
      233  Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
    BEATRICE
      234  I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
      235  pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
      236  not have come.
    BENEDICK
      237  You take pleasure then in the message?
    BEATRICE
      238  Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's
      239  point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
      240  signior: fare you well.
  Direction: Exit
    BENEDICK
      241  Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
      242  to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
      243  no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
      244  to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
      245  that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
      246  not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not
      247  love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.
  Direction: Exit
