          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The same.
  Direction: Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO
    DON JOHN
        1  It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the
        2  daughter of Leonato.
    BORACHIO
        3  Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.
    DON JOHN
        4  Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
        5  medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
        6  and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
        7  evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
    BORACHIO
        8  Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no
        9  dishonesty shall appear in me.
    DON JOHN
       10  Show me briefly how.
    BORACHIO
       11  I think I told your lordship a year since, how much
       12  I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
       13  gentlewoman to Hero.
    DON JOHN
       14  I remember.
    BORACHIO
       15  I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,
       16  appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.
    DON JOHN
       17  What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
    BORACHIO
       18  The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
       19  the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
       20  he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
       21  Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
       22  up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
    DON JOHN
       23  What proof shall I make of that?
    BORACHIO
       24  Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,
       25  to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any
       26  other issue?
    DON JOHN
       27  Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.
    BORACHIO
       28  Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
       29  the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
       30  that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
       31  prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
       32  honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
       33  reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
       34  semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
       35  thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
       36  offer them instances; which shall bear no less
       37  likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
       38  hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
       39  Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
       40  before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
       41  will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
       42  absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
       43  of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
       44  assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
    DON JOHN
       45  Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put
       46  it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and
       47  thy fee is a thousand ducats.
    BORACHIO
       48  Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning
       49  shall not shame me.
    DON JOHN
       50  I will presently go learn their day of marriage.
  Direction: Exeunt
