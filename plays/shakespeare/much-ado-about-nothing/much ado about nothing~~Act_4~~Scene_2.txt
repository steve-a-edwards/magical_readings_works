          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 4 : Scene 2

CENE II. A prison.
  Direction: Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and Sexton, in gowns; and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO
    DOGBERRY
        1  Is our whole dissembly appeared?
    VERGES
        2  O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.
    Sexton
        3  Which be the malefactors?
    DOGBERRY
        4  Marry, that am I and my partner.
    VERGES
        5  Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.
    Sexton
        6  But which are the offenders that are to be
        7  examined? let them come before master constable.
    DOGBERRY
        8  Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your
        9  name, friend?
    BORACHIO
       10  Borachio.
    DOGBERRY
       11  Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
    CONRADE
       12  I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
    DOGBERRY
       13  Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do
       14  you serve God?
    CONRADE BORACHIO
       15  Yea, sir, we hope.
    DOGBERRY
       16  Write down, that they hope they serve God: and
       17  write God first; for God defend but God should go
       18  before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
       19  that you are little better than false knaves; and it
       20  will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
       21  you for yourselves?
    CONRADE
       22  Marry, sir, we say we are none.
    DOGBERRY
       23  A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I
       24  will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a
       25  word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
       26  you are false knaves.
    BORACHIO
       27  Sir, I say to you we are none.
    DOGBERRY
       28  Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a
       29  tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?
    Sexton
       30  Master constable, you go not the way to examine:
       31  you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
    DOGBERRY
       32  Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch
       33  come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's
       34  name, accuse these men.
    First Watchman
       35  This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's
       36  brother, was a villain.
    DOGBERRY
       37  Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat
       38  perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.
    BORACHIO
       39  Master constable,--
    DOGBERRY
       40  Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,
       41  I promise thee.
    Sexton
       42  What heard you him say else?
    Second Watchman
       43  Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of
       44  Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
    DOGBERRY
       45  Flat burglary as ever was committed.
    VERGES
       46  Yea, by mass, that it is.
    Sexton
       47  What else, fellow?
    First Watchman
       48  And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to
       49  disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.
    DOGBERRY
       50  O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
       51  redemption for this.
    Sexton
       52  What else?
    Watchman
       53  This is all.
    Sexton
       54  And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
       55  Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;
       56  Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner
       57  refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.
       58  Master constable, let these men be bound, and
       59  brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show
       60  him their examination.
  Direction: Exit
    DOGBERRY
       61  Come, let them be opinioned.
    VERGES
       62  Let them be in the hands--
    CONRADE
       63  Off, coxcomb!
    DOGBERRY
       64  God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write
       65  down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.
       66  Thou naughty varlet!
    CONRADE
       67  Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.
    DOGBERRY
       68  Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
       69  suspect my years? O that he were here to write me
       70  down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an
       71  ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not
       72  that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of
       73  piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
       74  I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,
       75  and, which is more, a householder, and, which is
       76  more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
       77  Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a
       78  rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath
       79  had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every
       80  thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that
       81  I had been writ down an ass!
  Direction: Exeunt
