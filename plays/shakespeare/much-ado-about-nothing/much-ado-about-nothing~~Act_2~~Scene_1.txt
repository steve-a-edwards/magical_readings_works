          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.
  Direction: Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others
    LEONATO
        1  Was not Count John here at supper?
    ANTONIO
        2  I saw him not.
    BEATRICE
        3  How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
        4  him but I am heart-burned an hour after.
    HERO
        5  He is of a very melancholy disposition.
    BEATRICE
        6  He were an excellent man that were made just in the
        7  midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
        8  like an image and says nothing, and the other too
        9  like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
    LEONATO
       10  Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
       11  mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
       12  Benedick's face,--
    BEATRICE
       13  With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
       14  enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
       15  in the world, if a' could get her good-will.
    LEONATO
       16  By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
       17  husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
    ANTONIO
       18  In faith, she's too curst.
    BEATRICE
       19  Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
       20  sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst
       21  cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.
    LEONATO
       22  So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
    BEATRICE
       23  Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
       24  blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
       25  evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
       26  beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
    LEONATO
       27  You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
    BEATRICE
       28  What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
       29  and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
       30  beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
       31  beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
       32  a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
       33  man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
       34  sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
       35  apes into hell.
    LEONATO
       36  Well, then, go you into hell?
    BEATRICE
       37  No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet
       38  me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
       39  say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
       40  heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
       41  I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
       42  heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
       43  there live we as merry as the day is long.
    ANTONIO
  Direction: To HERO
       44  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled
       45  by your father.
    BEATRICE
       46  Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
       47  and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
       48  that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
       49  make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
       50  me.'
    LEONATO
       51  Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
    BEATRICE
       52  Not till God make men of some other metal than
       53  earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
       54  overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
       55  an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
       56  No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
       57  and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
    LEONATO
       58  Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince
       59  do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
    BEATRICE
       60  The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
       61  not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
       62  important, tell him there is measure in every thing
       63  and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
       64  wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
       65  a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
       66  and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
       67  fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
       68  measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
       69  repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
       70  cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
    LEONATO
       71  Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
    BEATRICE
       72  I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.
    LEONATO
       73  The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.
  Direction: All put on their masks
  Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked
    DON PEDRO
       74  Lady, will you walk about with your friend?
    HERO
       75  So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,
       76  I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.
    DON PEDRO
       77  With me in your company?
    HERO
       78  I may say so, when I please.
    DON PEDRO
       79  And when please you to say so?
    HERO
       80  When I like your favour; for God defend the lute
       81  should be like the case!
    DON PEDRO
       82  My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.
    HERO
       83  Why, then, your visor should be thatched.
    DON PEDRO
       84  Speak low, if you speak love.
  Direction: Drawing her aside
    BALTHASAR
       85  Well, I would you did like me.
    MARGARET
       86  So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many
       87  ill-qualities.
    BALTHASAR
       88  Which is one?
    MARGARET
       89  I say my prayers aloud.
    BALTHASAR
       90  I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.
    MARGARET
       91  God match me with a good dancer!
    BALTHASAR
       92  Amen.
    MARGARET
       93  And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is
       94  done! Answer, clerk.
    BALTHASAR
       95  No more words: the clerk is answered.
    URSULA
       96  I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.
    ANTONIO
       97  At a word, I am not.
    URSULA
       98  I know you by the waggling of your head.
    ANTONIO
       99  To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
    URSULA
      100  You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were
      101  the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you
      102  are he, you are he.
    ANTONIO
      103  At a word, I am not.
    URSULA
      104  Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your
      105  excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,
      106  mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an
      107  end.
    BEATRICE
      108  Will you not tell me who told you so?
    BENEDICK
      109  No, you shall pardon me.
    BEATRICE
      110  Nor will you not tell me who you are?
    BENEDICK
      111  Not now.
    BEATRICE
      112  That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
      113  out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
      114  Signior Benedick that said so.
    BENEDICK
      115  What's he?
    BEATRICE
      116  I am sure you know him well enough.
    BENEDICK
      117  Not I, believe me.
    BEATRICE
      118  Did he never make you laugh?
    BENEDICK
      119  I pray you, what is he?
    BEATRICE
      120  Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;
      121  only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
      122  none but libertines delight in him; and the
      123  commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
      124  for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
      125  they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
      126  the fleet: I would he had boarded me.
    BENEDICK
      127  When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
    BEATRICE
      128  Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
      129  which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
      130  strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a
      131  partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
      132  supper that night.
  Direction: Music
      133  We must follow the leaders.
    BENEDICK
      134  In every good thing.
    BEATRICE
      135  Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at
      136  the next turning.
  Direction: Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO
    DON JOHN
      137  Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
      138  withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
      139  The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.
    BORACHIO
      140  And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.
    DON JOHN
      141  Are not you Signior Benedick?
    CLAUDIO
      142  You know me well; I am he.
    DON JOHN
      143  Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
      144  he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him
      145  from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
      146  do the part of an honest man in it.
    CLAUDIO
      147  How know you he loves her?
    DON JOHN
      148  I heard him swear his affection.
    BORACHIO
      149  So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.
    DON JOHN
      150  Come, let us to the banquet.
  Direction: Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO
    CLAUDIO
      151  Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,
      152  But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
      153  'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
      154  Friendship is constant in all other things
      155  Save in the office and affairs of love:
      156  Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
      157  Let every eye negotiate for itself
      158  And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
      159  Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
      160  This is an accident of hourly proof,
      161  Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!
  Direction: Re-enter BENEDICK
    BENEDICK
      162  Count Claudio?
    CLAUDIO
      163  Yea, the same.
    BENEDICK
      164  Come, will you go with me?
    CLAUDIO
      165  Whither?
    BENEDICK
      166  Even to the next willow, about your own business,
      167  county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
      168  about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
      169  your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
      170  it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.
    CLAUDIO
      171  I wish him joy of her.
    BENEDICK
      172  Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
      173  sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
      174  have served you thus?
    CLAUDIO
      175  I pray you, leave me.
    BENEDICK
      176  Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
      177  boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.
    CLAUDIO
      178  If it will not be, I'll leave you.
  Direction: Exit
    BENEDICK
      179  Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
      180  But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
      181  know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
      182  under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
      183  am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
      184  is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
      185  that puts the world into her person and so gives me
      186  out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.
  Direction: Re-enter DON PEDRO
    DON PEDRO
      187  Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?
    BENEDICK
      188  Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
      189  I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
      190  warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
      191  that your grace had got the good will of this young
      192  lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
      193  either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
      194  to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
    DON PEDRO
      195  To be whipped! What's his fault?
    BENEDICK
      196  The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
      197  overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
      198  companion, and he steals it.
    DON PEDRO
      199  Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
      200  transgression is in the stealer.
    BENEDICK
      201  Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
      202  and the garland too; for the garland he might have
      203  worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
      204  you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.
    DON PEDRO
      205  I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
      206  the owner.
    BENEDICK
      207  If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
      208  you say honestly.
    DON PEDRO
      209  The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
      210  gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
      211  wronged by you.
    BENEDICK
      212  O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
      213  an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
      214  answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
      215  scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
      216  myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
      217  duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
      218  with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
      219  like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
      220  me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
      221  if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
      222  there were no living near her; she would infect to
      223  the north star. I would not marry her, though she
      224  were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
      225  he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
      226  turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
      227  the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
      228  her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
      229  some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
      230  she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
      231  sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
      232  would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
      233  and perturbation follows her.
    DON PEDRO
      234  Look, here she comes.
  Direction: Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO
    BENEDICK
      235  Will your grace command me any service to the
      236  world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
      237  to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
      238  I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
      239  furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
      240  Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great
      241  Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
      242  rather than hold three words' conference with this
      243  harpy. You have no employment for me?
    DON PEDRO
      244  None, but to desire your good company.
    BENEDICK
      245  O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
      246  endure my Lady Tongue.
  Direction: Exit
    DON PEDRO
      247  Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
      248  Signior Benedick.
    BEATRICE
      249  Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave
      250  him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
      251  marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
      252  therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.
    DON PEDRO
      253  You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
    BEATRICE
      254  So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I
      255  should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
      256  Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
    DON PEDRO
      257  Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?
    CLAUDIO
      258  Not sad, my lord.
    DON PEDRO
      259  How then? sick?
    CLAUDIO
      260  Neither, my lord.
    BEATRICE
      261  The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
      262  well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
      263  something of that jealous complexion.
    DON PEDRO
      264  I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
      265  though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
      266  false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
      267  fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
      268  and his good will obtained: name the day of
      269  marriage, and God give thee joy!
    LEONATO
      270  Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
      271  fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
      272  grace say Amen to it.
    BEATRICE
      273  Speak, count, 'tis your cue.
    CLAUDIO
      274  Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
      275  but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
      276  you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
      277  you and dote upon the exchange.
    BEATRICE
      278  Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
      279  with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.
    DON PEDRO
      280  In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
    BEATRICE
      281  Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
      282  the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
      283  ear that he is in her heart.
    CLAUDIO
      284  And so she doth, cousin.
    BEATRICE
      285  Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
      286  world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
      287  corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!
    DON PEDRO
      288  Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
    BEATRICE
      289  I would rather have one of your father's getting.
      290  Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
      291  father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
    DON PEDRO
      292  Will you have me, lady?
    BEATRICE
      293  No, my lord, unless I might have another for
      294  working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
      295  every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
      296  was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
    DON PEDRO
      297  Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
      298  becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
      299  a merry hour.
    BEATRICE
      300  No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
      301  was a star danced, and under that was I born.
      302  Cousins, God give you joy!
    LEONATO
      303  Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
    BEATRICE
      304  I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.
  Direction: Exit
    DON PEDRO
      305  By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
    LEONATO
      306  There's little of the melancholy element in her, my
      307  lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
      308  not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
      309  she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
      310  herself with laughing.
    DON PEDRO
      311  She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
    LEONATO
      312  O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.
    DON PEDRO
      313  She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
    LEONATO
      314  O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,
      315  they would talk themselves mad.
    DON PEDRO
      316  County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
    CLAUDIO
      317  To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
      318  have all his rites.
    LEONATO
      319  Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
      320  seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all
      321  things answer my mind.
    DON PEDRO
      322  Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:
      323  but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
      324  dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
      325  Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior
      326  Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
      327  affection the one with the other. I would fain have
      328  it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
      329  you three will but minister such assistance as I
      330  shall give you direction.
    LEONATO
      331  My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten
      332  nights' watchings.
    CLAUDIO
      333  And I, my lord.
    DON PEDRO
      334  And you too, gentle Hero?
    HERO
      335  I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my
      336  cousin to a good husband.
    DON PEDRO
      337  And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
      338  I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
      339  strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
      340  will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
      341  shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
      342  two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
      343  despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
      344  shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
      345  Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be
      346  ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,
      347  and I will tell you my drift.
  Direction: Exeunt
