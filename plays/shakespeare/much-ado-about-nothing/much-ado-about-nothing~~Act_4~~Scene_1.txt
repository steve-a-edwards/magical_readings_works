          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A church.
  Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and Attendants
    LEONATO
        1  Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain
        2  form of marriage, and you shall recount their
        3  particular duties afterwards.
    FRIAR FRANCIS
        4  You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.
    CLAUDIO
        5  No.
    LEONATO
        6  To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.
    FRIAR FRANCIS
        7  Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.
    HERO
        8  I do.
    FRIAR FRANCIS
        9  If either of you know any inward impediment why you
       10  should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
       11  to utter it.
    CLAUDIO
       12  Know you any, Hero?
    HERO
       13  None, my lord.
    FRIAR FRANCIS
       14  Know you any, count?
    LEONATO
       15  I dare make his answer, none.
    CLAUDIO
       16  O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
       17  do, not knowing what they do!
    BENEDICK
       18  How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
       19  laughing, as, ah, ha, he!
    CLAUDIO
       20  Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
       21  Will you with free and unconstrained soul
       22  Give me this maid, your daughter?
    LEONATO
       23  As freely, son, as God did give her me.
    CLAUDIO
       24  And what have I to give you back, whose worth
       25  May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
    DON PEDRO
       26  Nothing, unless you render her again.
    CLAUDIO
       27  Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
       28  There, Leonato, take her back again:
       29  Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
       30  She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
       31  Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
       32  O, what authority and show of truth
       33  Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
       34  Comes not that blood as modest evidence
       35  To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
       36  All you that see her, that she were a maid,
       37  By these exterior shows? But she is none:
       38  She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
       39  Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
    LEONATO
       40  What do you mean, my lord?
    CLAUDIO
       41  Not to be married,
       42  Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
    LEONATO
       43  Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
       44  Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
       45  And made defeat of her virginity,--
    CLAUDIO
       46  I know what you would say: if I have known her,
       47  You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
       48  And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
       49  No, Leonato,
       50  I never tempted her with word too large;
       51  But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
       52  Bashful sincerity and comely love.
    HERO
       53  And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?
    CLAUDIO
       54  Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
       55  You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
       56  As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
       57  But you are more intemperate in your blood
       58  Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
       59  That rage in savage sensuality.
    HERO
       60  Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
    LEONATO
       61  Sweet prince, why speak not you?
    DON PEDRO
       62  What should I speak?
       63  I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
       64  To link my dear friend to a common stale.
    LEONATO
       65  Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
    DON JOHN
       66  Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
    BENEDICK
       67  This looks not like a nuptial.
    HERO
       68  True! O God!
    CLAUDIO
       69  Leonato, stand I here?
       70  Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
       71  Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?
    LEONATO
       72  All this is so: but what of this, my lord?
    CLAUDIO
       73  Let me but move one question to your daughter;
       74  And, by that fatherly and kindly power
       75  That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
    LEONATO
       76  I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
    HERO
       77  O, God defend me! how am I beset!
       78  What kind of catechising call you this?
    CLAUDIO
       79  To make you answer truly to your name.
    HERO
       80  Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
       81  With any just reproach?
    CLAUDIO
       82  Marry, that can Hero;
       83  Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
       84  What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
       85  Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
       86  Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
    HERO
       87  I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.
    DON PEDRO
       88  Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
       89  I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
       90  Myself, my brother and this grieved count
       91  Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
       92  Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
       93  Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
       94  Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
       95  A thousand times in secret.
    DON JOHN
       96  Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
       97  Not to be spoke of;
       98  There is not chastity enough in language
       99  Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
      100  I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
    CLAUDIO
      101  O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
      102  If half thy outward graces had been placed
      103  About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
      104  But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
      105  Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
      106  For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
      107  And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
      108  To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
      109  And never shall it more be gracious.
    LEONATO
      110  Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?
  Direction: HERO swoons
    BEATRICE
      111  Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?
    DON JOHN
      112  Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,
      113  Smother her spirits up.
  Direction: Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO
    BENEDICK
      114  How doth the lady?
    BEATRICE
      115  Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
      116  Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!
    LEONATO
      117  O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
      118  Death is the fairest cover for her shame
      119  That may be wish'd for.
    BEATRICE
      120  How now, cousin Hero!
    FRIAR FRANCIS
      121  Have comfort, lady.
    LEONATO
      122  Dost thou look up?
    FRIAR FRANCIS
      123  Yea, wherefore should she not?
    LEONATO
      124  Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
      125  Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
      126  The story that is printed in her blood?
      127  Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:
      128  For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
      129  Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
      130  Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
      131  Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
      132  Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
      133  O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
      134  Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
      135  Why had I not with charitable hand
      136  Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
      137  Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
      138  I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
      139  This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
      140  But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
      141  And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
      142  That I myself was to myself not mine,
      143  Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
      144  Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
      145  Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
      146  And salt too little which may season give
      147  To her foul-tainted flesh!
    BENEDICK
      148  Sir, sir, be patient.
      149  For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
      150  I know not what to say.
    BEATRICE
      151  O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
    BENEDICK
      152  Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
    BEATRICE
      153  No, truly not; although, until last night,
      154  I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.
    LEONATO
      155  Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
      156  Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
      157  Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
      158  Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
      159  Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
    FRIAR FRANCIS
      160  Hear me a little;
      161  For I have only been silent so long
      162  And given way unto this course of fortune.
      163  ...
      164  By noting of the lady I have mark'd
      165  A thousand blushing apparitions
      166  To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
      167  In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
      168  And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
      169  To burn the errors that these princes hold
      170  Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
      171  Trust not my reading nor my observations,
      172  Which with experimental seal doth warrant
      173  The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
      174  My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
      175  If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
      176  Under some biting error.
    LEONATO
      177  Friar, it cannot be.
      178  Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
      179  Is that she will not add to her damnation
      180  A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
      181  Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
      182  That which appears in proper nakedness?
    FRIAR FRANCIS
      183  Lady, what man is he you are accused of?
    HERO
      184  They know that do accuse me; I know none:
      185  If I know more of any man alive
      186  Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
      187  Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
      188  Prove you that any man with me conversed
      189  At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
      190  Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
      191  Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
    FRIAR FRANCIS
      192  There is some strange misprision in the princes.
    BENEDICK
      193  Two of them have the very bent of honour;
      194  And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
      195  The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
      196  Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.
    LEONATO
      197  I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
      198  These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
      199  The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
      200  Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
      201  Nor age so eat up my invention,
      202  Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
      203  Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
      204  But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
      205  Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
      206  Ability in means and choice of friends,
      207  To quit me of them throughly.
    FRIAR FRANCIS
      208  Pause awhile,
      209  And let my counsel sway you in this case.
      210  Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
      211  Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
      212  And publish it that she is dead indeed;
      213  Maintain a mourning ostentation
      214  And on your family's old monument
      215  Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
      216  That appertain unto a burial.
    LEONATO
      217  What shall become of this? what will this do?
    FRIAR FRANCIS
      218  Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
      219  Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
      220  But not for that dream I on this strange course,
      221  But on this travail look for greater birth.
      222  She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
      223  Upon the instant that she was accused,
      224  Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
      225  Of every hearer: for it so falls out
      226  That what we have we prize not to the worth
      227  Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
      228  Why, then we rack the value, then we find
      229  The virtue that possession would not show us
      230  Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
      231  When he shall hear she died upon his words,
      232  The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
      233  Into his study of imagination,
      234  And every lovely organ of her life
      235  Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
      236  More moving-delicate and full of life,
      237  Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
      238  Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
      239  If ever love had interest in his liver,
      240  And wish he had not so accused her,
      241  No, though he thought his accusation true.
      242  Let this be so, and doubt not but success
      243  Will fashion the event in better shape
      244  Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
      245  But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
      246  The supposition of the lady's death
      247  Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
      248  And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
      249  As best befits her wounded reputation,
      250  In some reclusive and religious life,
      251  Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.
    BENEDICK
      252  Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
      253  And though you know my inwardness and love
      254  Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
      255  Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
      256  As secretly and justly as your soul
      257  Should with your body.
    LEONATO
      258  Being that I flow in grief,
      259  The smallest twine may lead me.
    FRIAR FRANCIS
      260  'Tis well consented: presently away;
      261  For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
      262  Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
      263  Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.
  Direction: Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE
    BENEDICK
      264  Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
    BEATRICE
      265  Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
    BENEDICK
      266  I will not desire that.
    BEATRICE
      267  You have no reason; I do it freely.
    BENEDICK
      268  Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
    BEATRICE
      269  Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
    BENEDICK
      270  Is there any way to show such friendship?
    BEATRICE
      271  A very even way, but no such friend.
    BENEDICK
      272  May a man do it?
    BEATRICE
      273  It is a man's office, but not yours.
    BENEDICK
      274  I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
      275  not that strange?
    BEATRICE
      276  As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
      277  possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
      278  you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
      279  confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.
    BENEDICK
      280  By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
    BEATRICE
      281  Do not swear, and eat it.
    BENEDICK
      282  I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make
      283  him eat it that says I love not you.
    BEATRICE
      284  Will you not eat your word?
    BENEDICK
      285  With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
      286  I love thee.
    BEATRICE
      287  Why, then, God forgive me!
    BENEDICK
      288  What offence, sweet Beatrice?
    BEATRICE
      289  You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
      290  protest I loved you.
    BENEDICK
      291  And do it with all thy heart.
    BEATRICE
      292  I love you with so much of my heart that none is
      293  left to protest.
    BENEDICK
      294  Come, bid me do any thing for thee.
    BEATRICE
      295  Kill Claudio.
    BENEDICK
      296  Ha! not for the wide world.
    BEATRICE
      297  You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
    BENEDICK
      298  Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
    BEATRICE
      299  I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in
      300  you: nay, I pray you, let me go.
    BENEDICK
      301  Beatrice,--
    BEATRICE
      302  In faith, I will go.
    BENEDICK
      303  We'll be friends first.
    BEATRICE
      304  You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
    BENEDICK
      305  Is Claudio thine enemy?
    BEATRICE
      306  Is he not approved in the height a villain, that
      307  hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
      308  that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
      309  come to take hands; and then, with public
      310  accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
      311  --O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
      312  in the market-place.
    BENEDICK
      313  Hear me, Beatrice,--
    BEATRICE
      314  Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!
    BENEDICK
      315  Nay, but, Beatrice,--
    BEATRICE
      316  Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
    BENEDICK
      317  Beat--
    BEATRICE
      318  Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,
      319  a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
      320  surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
      321  had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
      322  manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
      323  compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
      324  trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
      325  that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
      326  man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
    BENEDICK
      327  Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
    BEATRICE
      328  Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
    BENEDICK
      329  Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?
    BEATRICE
      330  Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.

      331  Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will
      332  kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,

      334  hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
      335  cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.
  Direction: Exeunt
