          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 3 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. HERO's apartment.
  Direction: Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA
    HERO
        1  Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire
        2  her to rise.
    URSULA
        3  I will, lady.
    HERO
        4  And bid her come hither.
    URSULA
        5  Well.
  Direction: Exit
    MARGARET
        6  Troth, I think your other rabato were better.
    HERO
        7  No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.
    MARGARET
        8  By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your
        9  cousin will say so.
    HERO
       10  My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear
       11  none but this.
    MARGARET
       12  I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair
       13  were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare
       14  fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's
       15  gown that they praise so.
    HERO
       16  O, that exceeds, they say.
    MARGARET
       17  By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of
       18  yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with
       19  silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,
       20  and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:
       21  but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent
       22  fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.
    HERO
       23  God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is
       24  exceeding heavy.
    MARGARET
       25  'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.
    HERO
       26  Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?
    MARGARET
       27  Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not
       28  marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord
       29  honourable without marriage? I think you would have
       30  me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad
       31  thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend
       32  nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a
       33  husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband
       34  and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not
       35  heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.
  Direction: Enter BEATRICE
    HERO
       36  Good morrow, coz.
    BEATRICE
       37  Good morrow, sweet Hero.
    HERO
       38  Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?
    BEATRICE
       39  I am out of all other tune, methinks.
    MARGARET
       40  Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a
       41  burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.
    BEATRICE
       42  Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
       43  husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall
       44  lack no barns.
    MARGARET
       45  O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.
    BEATRICE
       46  'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were
       47  ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!
    MARGARET
       48  For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?
    BEATRICE
       49  For the letter that begins them all, H.
    MARGARET
       50  Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more
       51  sailing by the star.
    BEATRICE
       52  What means the fool, trow?
    MARGARET
       53  Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!
    HERO
       54  These gloves the count sent me; they are an
       55  excellent perfume.
    BEATRICE
       56  I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.
    MARGARET
       57  A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.
    BEATRICE
       58  O, God help me! God help me! how long have you
       59  professed apprehension?
    MARGARET
       60  Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?
    BEATRICE
       61  It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your
       62  cap. By my troth, I am sick.
    MARGARET
       63  Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,
       64  and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.
    HERO
       65  There thou prickest her with a thistle.
    BEATRICE
       66  Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in
       67  this Benedictus.
    MARGARET
       68  Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I
       69  meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance
       70  that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am
       71  not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list
       72  not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,
       73  if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you
       74  are in love or that you will be in love or that you
       75  can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and
       76  now is he become a man: he swore he would never
       77  marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
       78  his meat without grudging: and how you may be
       79  converted I know not, but methinks you look with
       80  your eyes as other women do.
    BEATRICE
       81  What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?
    MARGARET
       82  Not a false gallop.
  Direction: Re-enter URSULA
    URSULA
       83  Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior
       84  Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the
       85  town, are come to fetch you to church.
    HERO
       86  Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.
  Direction: Exeunt
