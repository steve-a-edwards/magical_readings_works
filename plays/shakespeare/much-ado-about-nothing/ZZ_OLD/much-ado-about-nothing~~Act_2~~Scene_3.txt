          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 2 : Scene 3

SCENE III. LEONATO'S orchard.
  Direction: Enter BENEDICK
    BENEDICK
        1  Boy!
  Direction: Enter Boy
    Boy
        2  Signior?
    BENEDICK
        3  In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither
        4  to me in the orchard.
    Boy
        5  I am here already, sir.
    BENEDICK
        6  I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.
  Direction: Exit Boy
        7  I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
        8  another man is a fool when he dedicates his
        9  behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
       10  such shallow follies in others, become the argument
       11  of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
       12  is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
       13  with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
       14  rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
       15  when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
       16  good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
       17  carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
       18  speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
       19  and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
       20  words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
       21  strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
       22  these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
       23  be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
       24  I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
       25  of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
       26  is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
       27  well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
       28  graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
       29  my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
       30  or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;
       31  fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not
       32  near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
       33  discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
       34  be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
       35  Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.
  Direction: Withdraws
  Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO
    DON PEDRO
       36  Come, shall we hear this music?
    CLAUDIO
       37  Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
       38  As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!
    DON PEDRO
       39  See you where Benedick hath hid himself?
    CLAUDIO
       40  O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
       41  We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.
  Direction: Enter BALTHASAR with Music
    DON PEDRO
       42  Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
    BALTHASAR
       43  O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
       44  To slander music any more than once.
    DON PEDRO
       45  It is the witness still of excellency
       46  To put a strange face on his own perfection.
       47  I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
    BALTHASAR
       48  Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
       49  Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
       50  To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
       51  Yet will he swear he loves.
    DON PEDRO
       52  Now, pray thee, come;
       53  Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
       54  Do it in notes.
    BALTHASAR
       55  Note this before my notes;
       56  There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
    DON PEDRO
       57  Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
       58  Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.
  Direction: Air
    BENEDICK
       59  Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it
       60  not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out
       61  of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when
       62  all's done.
  Direction: The Song
    BALTHASAR
       63  Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
       64  Men were deceivers ever,
       65  One foot in sea and one on shore,
       66  To one thing constant never:
       67  Then sigh not so, but let them go,
       68  And be you blithe and bonny,
       69  Converting all your sounds of woe
       70  Into Hey nonny, nonny.
       71  Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
       72  Of dumps so dull and heavy;
       73  The fraud of men was ever so,
       74  Since summer first was leafy:
       75  Then sigh not so, but let them go
       76  And be you blithe and bonny,
       77  Converting all your sounds of woe
       78  Into Hey, nonny nonny.
    DON PEDRO
       79  By my troth, a good song.
    BALTHASAR
       80  And an ill singer, my lord.
    DON PEDRO
       81  Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.
    BENEDICK
       82  An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,
       83  they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad
       84  voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the
       85  night-raven, come what plague could have come after
       86  it.
    DON PEDRO
       87  Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,
       88  get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we
       89  would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.
    BALTHASAR
       90  The best I can, my lord.
    DON PEDRO
       91  Do so: farewell.
  Direction: Exit BALTHASAR
       92  Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of
       93  to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with
       94  Signior Benedick?
    CLAUDIO
       95  O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did
       96  never think that lady would have loved any man.
    LEONATO
       97  No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she
       98  should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in
       99  all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
    BENEDICK
      100  Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
    LEONATO
      101  By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think
      102  of it but that she loves him with an enraged
      103  affection: it is past the infinite of thought.
    DON PEDRO
      104  May be she doth but counterfeit.
    CLAUDIO
      105  Faith, like enough.
    LEONATO
      106  O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of
      107  passion came so near the life of passion as she
      108  discovers it.
    DON PEDRO
      109  Why, what effects of passion shows she?
    CLAUDIO
      110  Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
    LEONATO
      111  What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard
      112  my daughter tell you how.
    CLAUDIO
      113  She did, indeed.
    DON PEDRO
      114  How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
      115  thought her spirit had been invincible against all
      116  assaults of affection.
    LEONATO
      117  I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially
      118  against Benedick.
    BENEDICK
      119  I should think this a gull, but that the
      120  white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
      121  sure, hide himself in such reverence.
    CLAUDIO
      122  He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.
    DON PEDRO
      123  Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
    LEONATO
      124  No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.
    CLAUDIO
      125  'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
      126  I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
      127  with scorn, write to him that I love him?'
    LEONATO
      128  This says she now when she is beginning to write to
      129  him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
      130  there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
      131  sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
    CLAUDIO
      132  Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
      133  pretty jest your daughter told us of.
    LEONATO
      134  O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
      135  found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
    CLAUDIO
      136  That.
    LEONATO
      137  O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;
      138  railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
      139  to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
      140  measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I
      141  should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
      142  love him, I should.'
    CLAUDIO
      143  Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
      144  beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
      145  sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'
    LEONATO
      146  She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
      147  ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
      148  is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
      149  to herself: it is very true.
    DON PEDRO
      150  It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
      151  other, if she will not discover it.
    CLAUDIO
      152  To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
      153  torment the poor lady worse.
    DON PEDRO
      154  An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
      155  excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
      156  she is virtuous.
    CLAUDIO
      157  And she is exceeding wise.
    DON PEDRO
      158  In every thing but in loving Benedick.
    LEONATO
      159  O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender
      160  a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
      161  the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
      162  cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
    DON PEDRO
      163  I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
      164  have daffed all other respects and made her half
      165  myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
      166  what a' will say.
    LEONATO
      167  Were it good, think you?
    CLAUDIO
      168  Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
      169  will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
      170  she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
      171  her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
      172  accustomed crossness.
    DON PEDRO
      173  She doth well: if she should make tender of her
      174  love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
      175  man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
    CLAUDIO
      176  He is a very proper man.
    DON PEDRO
      177  He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
    CLAUDIO
      178  Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.
    DON PEDRO
      179  He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
    CLAUDIO
      180  And I take him to be valiant.
    DON PEDRO
      181  As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
      182  quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
      183  avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
      184  them with a most Christian-like fear.
    LEONATO
      185  If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:
      186  if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
      187  quarrel with fear and trembling.
    DON PEDRO
      188  And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
      189  howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
      190  he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
      191  we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?
    CLAUDIO
      192  Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
      193  good counsel.
    LEONATO
      194  Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
    DON PEDRO
      195  Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:
      196  let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
      197  could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
      198  how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
    LEONATO
      199  My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.
    CLAUDIO
      200  If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
      201  trust my expectation.
    DON PEDRO
      202  Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
      203  must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
      204  sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
      205  another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
      206  scene that I would see, which will be merely a
      207  dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.
  Direction: Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO
    BENEDICK
  Direction: Coming forward
      208  This can be no trick: the
      209  conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
      210  this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
      211  seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
      212  why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
      213  they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
      214  the love come from her; they say too that she will
      215  rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
      216  never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
      217  are they that hear their detractions and can put
      218  them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
      219  truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
      220  so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
      221  me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
      222  no great argument of her folly, for I will be
      223  horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
      224  odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
      225  because I have railed so long against marriage: but
      226  doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
      227  in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
      228  Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
      229  the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
      230  No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
      231  die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
      232  were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
      233  she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
      234  her.
  Direction: Enter BEATRICE
    BEATRICE
      235  Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
    BENEDICK
      236  Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
    BEATRICE
      237  I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
      238  pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
      239  not have come.
    BENEDICK
      240  You take pleasure then in the message?
    BEATRICE
      241  Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's
      242  point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
      243  signior: fare you well.
  Direction: Exit
    BENEDICK
      244  Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
      245  to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
      246  no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
      247  to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
      248  that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
      249  not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not
      250  love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.
  Direction: Exit
