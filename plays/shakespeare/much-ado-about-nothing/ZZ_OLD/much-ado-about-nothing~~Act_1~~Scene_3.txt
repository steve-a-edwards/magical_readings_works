          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 1 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The same.
  Direction: Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE
    CONRADE
        1  What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out
        2  of measure sad?
    DON JOHN
        3  There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;
        4  therefore the sadness is without limit.
    CONRADE
        5  You should hear reason.
    DON JOHN
        6  And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
    CONRADE
        7  If not a present remedy, at least a patient
        8  sufferance.
    DON JOHN
        9  I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,
       10  born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
       11  medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
       12  what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
       13  at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait
       14  for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and
       15  tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and
       16  claw no man in his humour.
    CONRADE
       17  Yea, but you must not make the full show of this
       18  till you may do it without controlment. You have of
       19  late stood out against your brother, and he hath
       20  ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is
       21  impossible you should take true root but by the
       22  fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
       23  that you frame the season for your own harvest.
    DON JOHN
       24  I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
       25  his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
       26  disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
       27  love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
       28  be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
       29  but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
       30  a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
       31  have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
       32  mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
       33  my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
       34  seek not to alter me.
    CONRADE
       35  Can you make no use of your discontent?
    DON JOHN
       36  I make all use of it, for I use it only.
       37  Who comes here?
  Direction: Enter BORACHIO
       38  What news, Borachio?
    BORACHIO
       39  I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
       40  brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
       41  can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.
    DON JOHN
       42  Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
       43  What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
       44  unquietness?
    BORACHIO
       45  Marry, it is your brother's right hand.
    DON JOHN
       46  Who? the most exquisite Claudio?
    BORACHIO
       47  Even he.
    DON JOHN
       48  A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks
       49  he?
    BORACHIO
       50  Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
    DON JOHN
       51  A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
    BORACHIO
       52  Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a
       53  musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
       54  in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
       55  arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
       56  prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
       57  obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.
    DON JOHN
       58  Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
       59  my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
       60  glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
       61  bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?
    CONRADE
       62  To the death, my lord.
    DON JOHN
       63  Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the
       64  greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
       65  my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?
    BORACHIO
       66  We'll wait upon your lordship.
  Direction: Exeunt
