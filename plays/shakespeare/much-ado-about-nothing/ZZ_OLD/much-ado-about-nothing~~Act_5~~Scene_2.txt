          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 5 : Scene 2

SCENE II. LEONATO'S garden.
  Direction: Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meeting
    BENEDICK
        1  Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at
        2  my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
    MARGARET
        3  Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
    BENEDICK
        4  In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living
        5  shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou
        6  deservest it.
    MARGARET
        7  To have no man come over me! why, shall I always
        8  keep below stairs?
    BENEDICK
        9  Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.
    MARGARET
       10  And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,
       11  but hurt not.
    BENEDICK
       12  A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a
       13  woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give
       14  thee the bucklers.
    MARGARET
       15  Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
    BENEDICK
       16  If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the
       17  pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
    MARGARET
       18  Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
    BENEDICK
       19  And therefore will come.
  Direction: Exit MARGARET
  Direction: Sings
       20  The god of love,
       21  That sits above,
       22  And knows me, and knows me,
       23  How pitiful I deserve,--
       24  I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
       25  swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
       26  a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
       27  whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
       28  blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
       29  over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
       30  cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find
       31  out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
       32  rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,
       33  'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous
       34  endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
       35  nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
  Direction: Enter BEATRICE
       36  Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
    BEATRICE
       37  Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.
    BENEDICK
       38  O, stay but till then!
    BEATRICE
       39  'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
       40  I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
       41  knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
    BENEDICK
       42  Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
    BEATRICE
       43  Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
       44  foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
       45  will depart unkissed.
    BENEDICK
       46  Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
       47  so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
       48  plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
       49  I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
       50  him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
       51  which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
    BEATRICE
       52  For them all together; which maintained so politic
       53  a state of evil that they will not admit any good
       54  part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
       55  good parts did you first suffer love for me?
    BENEDICK
       56  Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
       57  indeed, for I love thee against my will.
    BEATRICE
       58  In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
       59  If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
       60  yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.
    BENEDICK
       61  Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
    BEATRICE
       62  It appears not in this confession: there's not one
       63  wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
    BENEDICK
       64  An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
       65  the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
       66  in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
       67  no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
       68  widow weeps.
    BEATRICE
       69  And how long is that, think you?
    BENEDICK
       70  Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
       71  rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
       72  wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
       73  impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
       74  own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
       75  praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
       76  praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?
    BEATRICE
       77  Very ill.
    BENEDICK
       78  And how do you?
    BEATRICE
       79  Very ill too.
    BENEDICK
       80  Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
       81  you too, for here comes one in haste.
  Direction: Enter URSULA
    URSULA
       82  Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old
       83  coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
       84  falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
       85  abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is
       86  fed and gone. Will you come presently?
    BEATRICE
       87  Will you go hear this news, signior?
    BENEDICK
       88  I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
       89  buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with
       90  thee to thy uncle's.
  Direction: Exeunt
