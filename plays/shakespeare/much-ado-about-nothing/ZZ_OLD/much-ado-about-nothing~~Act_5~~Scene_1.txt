          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.
  Direction: Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO
    ANTONIO
        1  If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:
        2  And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
        3  Against yourself.
    LEONATO
        4  I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
        5  Which falls into mine ears as profitless
        6  As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
        7  Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
        8  But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
        9  Bring me a father that so loved his child,
       10  Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
       11  And bid him speak of patience;
       12  Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
       13  And let it answer every strain for strain,
       14  As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
       15  In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
       16  If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
       17  Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,
       18  Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
       19  With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
       20  And I of him will gather patience.
       21  But there is no such man: for, brother, men
       22  Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
       23  Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
       24  Their counsel turns to passion, which before
       25  Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
       26  Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
       27  Charm ache with air and agony with words:
       28  No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
       29  To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
       30  But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
       31  To be so moral when he shall endure
       32  The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
       33  My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
    ANTONIO
       34  Therein do men from children nothing differ.
    LEONATO
       35  I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;
       36  For there was never yet philosopher
       37  That could endure the toothache patiently,
       38  However they have writ the style of gods
       39  And made a push at chance and sufferance.
    ANTONIO
       40  Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
       41  Make those that do offend you suffer too.
    LEONATO
       42  There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.
       43  My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;
       44  And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince
       45  And all of them that thus dishonour her.
    ANTONIO
       46  Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.
  Direction: Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO
    DON PEDRO
       47  Good den, good den.
    CLAUDIO
       48  Good day to both of you.
    LEONATO
       49  Hear you. my lords,--
    DON PEDRO
       50  We have some haste, Leonato.
    LEONATO
       51  Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:
       52  Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.
    DON PEDRO
       53  Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
    ANTONIO
       54  If he could right himself with quarreling,
       55  Some of us would lie low.
    CLAUDIO
       56  Who wrongs him?
    LEONATO
       57  Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--
       58  Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
       59  I fear thee not.
    CLAUDIO
       60  Marry, beshrew my hand,
       61  If it should give your age such cause of fear:
       62  In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
    LEONATO
       63  Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:
       64  I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
       65  As under privilege of age to brag
       66  What I have done being young, or what would do
       67  Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
       68  Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
       69  That I am forced to lay my reverence by
       70  And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
       71  Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
       72  I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;
       73  Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
       74  And she lies buried with her ancestors;
       75  O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
       76  Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!
    CLAUDIO
       77  My villany?
    LEONATO
       78  Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.
    DON PEDRO
       79  You say not right, old man.
    LEONATO
       80  My lord, my lord,
       81  I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
       82  Despite his nice fence and his active practise,
       83  His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.
    CLAUDIO
       84  Away! I will not have to do with you.
    LEONATO
       85  Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
       86  If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
    ANTONIO
       87  He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
       88  But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
       89  Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
       90  Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:
       91  Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
       92  Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
    LEONATO
       93  Brother,--
    ANTONIO
       94  Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
       95  And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
       96  That dare as well answer a man indeed
       97  As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:
       98  Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!
    LEONATO
       99  Brother Antony,--
    ANTONIO
      100  Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
      101  And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--
      102  Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
      103  That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
      104  Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
      105  And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
      106  How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
      107  And this is all.
    LEONATO
      108  But, brother Antony,--
    ANTONIO
      109  Come, 'tis no matter:
      110  Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
    DON PEDRO
      111  Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
      112  My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
      113  But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing
      114  But what was true and very full of proof.
    LEONATO
      115  My lord, my lord,--
    DON PEDRO
      116  I will not hear you.
    LEONATO
      117  No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.
    ANTONIO
      118  And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
  Direction: Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO
    DON PEDRO
      119  See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
  Direction: Enter BENEDICK
    CLAUDIO
      120  Now, signior, what news?
    BENEDICK
      121  Good day, my lord.
    DON PEDRO
      122  Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part
      123  almost a fray.
    CLAUDIO
      124  We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
      125  with two old men without teeth.
    DON PEDRO
      126  Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had
      127  we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
    BENEDICK
      128  In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
      129  to seek you both.
    CLAUDIO
      130  We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are
      131  high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
      132  away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
    BENEDICK
      133  It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?
    DON PEDRO
      134  Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
    CLAUDIO
      135  Never any did so, though very many have been beside
      136  their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
      137  minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.
    DON PEDRO
      138  As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou
      139  sick, or angry?
    CLAUDIO
      140  What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,
      141  thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
    BENEDICK
      142  Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you
      143  charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.
    CLAUDIO
      144  Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was
      145  broke cross.
    DON PEDRO
      146  By this light, he changes more and more: I think
      147  he be angry indeed.
    CLAUDIO
      148  If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
    BENEDICK
      149  Shall I speak a word in your ear?
    CLAUDIO
      150  God bless me from a challenge!
    BENEDICK
  Direction: Aside to CLAUDIO
      151  You are a villain; I jest not:
      152  I will make it good how you dare, with what you
      153  dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will
      154  protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet
      155  lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me
      156  hear from you.
    CLAUDIO
      157  Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
    DON PEDRO
      158  What, a feast, a feast?
    CLAUDIO
      159  I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's
      160  head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most
      161  curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find
      162  a woodcock too?
    BENEDICK
      163  Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
    DON PEDRO
      164  I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
      165  other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'
      166  said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a
      167  great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
      168  'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
      169  hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
      170  is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
      171  'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
      172  believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
      173  Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
      174  there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
      175  did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
      176  virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
      177  wast the properest man in Italy.
    CLAUDIO
      178  For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
      179  not.
    DON PEDRO
      180  Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she
      181  did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
      182  the old man's daughter told us all.
    CLAUDIO
      183  All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was
      184  hid in the garden.
    DON PEDRO
      185  But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
      186  the sensible Benedick's head?
    CLAUDIO
      187  Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the
      188  married man'?
    BENEDICK
      189  Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave
      190  you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests
      191  as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,
      192  hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
      193  you: I must discontinue your company: your brother
      194  the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among
      195  you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord
      196  Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till
      197  then, peace be with him.
  Direction: Exit
    DON PEDRO
      198  He is in earnest.
    CLAUDIO
      199  In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for
      200  the love of Beatrice.
    DON PEDRO
      201  And hath challenged thee.
    CLAUDIO
      202  Most sincerely.
    DON PEDRO
      203  What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
      204  doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!
    CLAUDIO
      205  He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a
      206  doctor to such a man.
    DON PEDRO
      207  But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and
      208  be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?
  Direction: Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO
    DOGBERRY
      209  Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she
      210  shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,
      211  an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.
    DON PEDRO
      212  How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio
      213  one!
    CLAUDIO
      214  Hearken after their offence, my lord.
    DON PEDRO
      215  Officers, what offence have these men done?
    DOGBERRY
      216  Marry, sir, they have committed false report;
      217  moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,
      218  they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have
      219  belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust
      220  things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
    DON PEDRO
      221  First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I
      222  ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why
      223  they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay
      224  to their charge.
    CLAUDIO
      225  Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by
      226  my troth, there's one meaning well suited.
    DON PEDRO
      227  Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus
      228  bound to your answer? this learned constable is
      229  too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?
    BORACHIO
      230  Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:
      231  do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
      232  deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
      233  could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
      234  to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
      235  to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
      236  to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
      237  the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
      238  garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
      239  marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
      240  I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
      241  to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
      242  master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire
      243  nothing but the reward of a villain.
    DON PEDRO
      244  Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
    CLAUDIO
      245  I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.
    DON PEDRO
      246  But did my brother set thee on to this?
    BORACHIO
      247  Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.
    DON PEDRO
      248  He is composed and framed of treachery:
      249  And fled he is upon this villany.
    CLAUDIO
      250  Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
      251  In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
    DOGBERRY
      252  Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our
      253  sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
      254  and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time
      255  and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
    VERGES
      256  Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the
      257  Sexton too.
  Direction: Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the Sexton
    LEONATO
      258  Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,
      259  That, when I note another man like him,
      260  I may avoid him: which of these is he?
    BORACHIO
      261  If you would know your wronger, look on me.
    LEONATO
      262  Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
      263  Mine innocent child?
    BORACHIO
      264  Yea, even I alone.
    LEONATO
      265  No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
      266  Here stand a pair of honourable men;
      267  A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
      268  I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:
      269  Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
      270  'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
    CLAUDIO
      271  I know not how to pray your patience;
      272  Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
      273  Impose me to what penance your invention
      274  Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
      275  But in mistaking.
    DON PEDRO
      276  By my soul, nor I:
      277  And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
      278  I would bend under any heavy weight
      279  That he'll enjoin me to.
    LEONATO
      280  I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
      281  That were impossible: but, I pray you both,
      282  Possess the people in Messina here
      283  How innocent she died; and if your love
      284  Can labour ought in sad invention,
      285  Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
      286  And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:
      287  To-morrow morning come you to my house,
      288  And since you could not be my son-in-law,
      289  Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
      290  Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
      291  And she alone is heir to both of us:
      292  Give her the right you should have given her cousin,
      293  And so dies my revenge.
    CLAUDIO
      294  O noble sir,
      295  Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
      296  I do embrace your offer; and dispose
      297  For henceforth of poor Claudio.
    LEONATO
      298  To-morrow then I will expect your coming;
      299  To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
      300  Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
      301  Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,
      302  Hired to it by your brother.
    BORACHIO
      303  No, by my soul, she was not,
      304  Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
      305  But always hath been just and virtuous
      306  In any thing that I do know by her.
    DOGBERRY
      307  Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and
      308  black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call
      309  me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his
      310  punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
      311  one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and
      312  a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's
      313  name, the which he hath used so long and never paid
      314  that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing
      315  for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.
    LEONATO
      316  I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
    DOGBERRY
      317  Your worship speaks like a most thankful and
      318  reverend youth; and I praise God for you.
    LEONATO
      319  There's for thy pains.
    DOGBERRY
      320  God save the foundation!
    LEONATO
      321  Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.
    DOGBERRY
      322  I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I
      323  beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the
      324  example of others. God keep your worship! I wish
      325  your worship well; God restore you to health! I
