          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house.
  Direction: Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting
    LEONATO
        1  How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?
        2  hath he provided this music?
    ANTONIO
        3  He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
        4  you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
    LEONATO
        5  Are they good?
    ANTONIO
        6  As the event stamps them: but they have a good
        7  cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
        8  Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
        9  orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
       10  the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
       11  niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
       12  this night in a dance: and if he found her
       13  accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
       14  top and instantly break with you of it.
    LEONATO
       15  Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
    ANTONIO
       16  A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
       17  question him yourself.
    LEONATO
       18  No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear
       19  itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
       20  that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
       21  if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
  Direction: Enter Attendants
       22  Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you
       23  mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your
       24  skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
  Direction: Exeunt
