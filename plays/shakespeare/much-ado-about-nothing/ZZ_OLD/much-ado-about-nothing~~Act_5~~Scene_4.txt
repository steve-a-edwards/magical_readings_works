          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 5 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. A room in LEONATO'S house.
  Direction: Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, BENEDICK, BEATRICE, MARGARET, URSULA, FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO
    FRIAR FRANCIS
        1  Did I not tell you she was innocent?
    LEONATO
        2  So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her
        3  Upon the error that you heard debated:
        4  But Margaret was in some fault for this,
        5  Although against her will, as it appears
        6  In the true course of all the question.
    ANTONIO
        7  Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
    BENEDICK
        8  And so am I, being else by faith enforced
        9  To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
    LEONATO
       10  Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,
       11  Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
       12  And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.
  Direction: Exeunt Ladies
       13  The prince and Claudio promised by this hour
       14  To visit me. You know your office, brother:
       15  You must be father to your brother's daughter
       16  And give her to young Claudio.
    ANTONIO
       17  Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
    BENEDICK
       18  Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
    FRIAR FRANCIS
       19  To do what, signior?
    BENEDICK
       20  To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
       21  Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
       22  Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.
    LEONATO
       23  That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.
    BENEDICK
       24  And I do with an eye of love requite her.
    LEONATO
       25  The sight whereof I think you had from me,
       26  From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?
    BENEDICK
       27  Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
       28  But, for my will, my will is your good will
       29  May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
       30  In the state of honourable marriage:
       31  In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.
    LEONATO
       32  My heart is with your liking.
    FRIAR FRANCIS
       33  And my help.
       34  Here comes the prince and Claudio.
  Direction: Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or three others
    DON PEDRO
       35  Good morrow to this fair assembly.
    LEONATO
       36  Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:
       37  We here attend you. Are you yet determined
       38  To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?
    CLAUDIO
       39  I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.
    LEONATO
       40  Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.
  Direction: Exit ANTONIO
    DON PEDRO
       41  Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
       42  That you have such a February face,
       43  So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?
    CLAUDIO
       44  I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
       45  Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
       46  And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
       47  As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
       48  When he would play the noble beast in love.
    BENEDICK
       49  Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
       50  And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
       51  And got a calf in that same noble feat
       52  Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.
    CLAUDIO
       53  For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.
  Direction: Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked
       54  Which is the lady I must seize upon?
    ANTONIO
       55  This same is she, and I do give you her.
    CLAUDIO
       56  Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.
    LEONATO
       57  No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
       58  Before this friar and swear to marry her.
    CLAUDIO
       59  Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
       60  I am your husband, if you like of me.
    HERO
       61  And when I lived, I was your other wife:
  Direction: Unmasking
       62  And when you loved, you were my other husband.
    CLAUDIO
       63  Another Hero!
    HERO
       64  Nothing certainer:
       65  One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
       66  And surely as I live, I am a maid.
    DON PEDRO
       67  The former Hero! Hero that is dead!
    LEONATO
       68  She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.
    FRIAR FRANCIS
       69  All this amazement can I qualify:
       70  When after that the holy rites are ended,
       71  I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:
       72  Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
       73  And to the chapel let us presently.
    BENEDICK
       74  Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?
    BEATRICE
  Direction: Unmasking
       75  I answer to that name. What is your will?
    BENEDICK
       76  Do not you love me?
    BEATRICE
       77  Why, no; no more than reason.
    BENEDICK
       78  Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
       79  Have been deceived; they swore you did.
    BEATRICE
       80  Do not you love me?
    BENEDICK
       81  Troth, no; no more than reason.
    BEATRICE
       82  Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
       83  Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.
    BENEDICK
       84  They swore that you were almost sick for me.
    BEATRICE
       85  They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
    BENEDICK
       86  'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
    BEATRICE
       87  No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
    LEONATO
       88  Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
    CLAUDIO
       89  And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
       90  For here's a paper written in his hand,
       91  A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
       92  Fashion'd to Beatrice.
    HERO
       93  And here's another
       94  Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,
       95  Containing her affection unto Benedick.
    BENEDICK
       96  A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.
       97  Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take
       98  thee for pity.
    BEATRICE
       99  I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield
      100  upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
      101  for I was told you were in a consumption.
    BENEDICK
      102  Peace! I will stop your mouth.
  Direction: Kissing her
    DON PEDRO
      103  How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
    BENEDICK
      104  I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of
      105  wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
      106  thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No:
      107  if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
      108  nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
      109  purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
      110  purpose that the world can say against it; and
      111  therefore never flout at me for what I have said
      112  against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
      113  conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
      114  have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
      115  kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.
    CLAUDIO
      116  I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
      117  that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
      118  life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
      119  question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
      120  exceedingly narrowly to thee.
    BENEDICK
      121  Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
      122  we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts
      123  and our wives' heels.
    LEONATO
      124  We'll have dancing afterward.
    BENEDICK
      125  First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
      126  thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:
      127  there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
    Messenger
      128  My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,
      129  And brought with armed men back to Messina.
    BENEDICK
      130  Think not on him till to-morrow:
      131  I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.
      132  Strike up, pipers.
  Direction: Dance
  Direction: Exeunt
