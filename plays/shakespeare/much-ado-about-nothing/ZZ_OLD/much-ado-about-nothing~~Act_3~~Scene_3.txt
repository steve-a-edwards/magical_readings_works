          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 3 : Scene 3

SCENE III. A street.
  Direction: Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch
    DOGBERRY
        1  Are you good men and true?
    VERGES
        2  Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer
        3  salvation, body and soul.
    DOGBERRY
        4  Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
        5  they should have any allegiance in them, being
        6  chosen for the prince's watch.
    VERGES
        7  Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
    DOGBERRY
        8  First, who think you the most desertless man to be
        9  constable?
    First Watchman
       10  Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can
       11  write and read.
    DOGBERRY
       12  Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
       13  you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
       14  the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.
    Second Watchman
       15  Both which, master constable,--
    DOGBERRY
       16  You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
       17  for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
       18  no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
       19  let that appear when there is no need of such
       20  vanity. You are thought here to be the most
       21  senseless and fit man for the constable of the
       22  watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
       23  charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
       24  to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.
    Second Watchman
       25  How if a' will not stand?
    DOGBERRY
       26  Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and
       27  presently call the rest of the watch together and
       28  thank God you are rid of a knave.
    VERGES
       29  If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
       30  of the prince's subjects.
    DOGBERRY
       31  True, and they are to meddle with none but the
       32  prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
       33  the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
       34  talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
    Watchman
       35  We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
       36  belongs to a watch.
    DOGBERRY
       37  Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
       38  watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
       39  offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
       40  stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
       41  ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
    Watchman
       42  How if they will not?
    DOGBERRY
       43  Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
       44  they make you not then the better answer, you may
       45  say they are not the men you took them for.
    Watchman
       46  Well, sir.
    DOGBERRY
       47  If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
       48  of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
       49  kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
       50  why the more is for your honesty.
    Watchman
       51  If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
       52  hands on him?
    DOGBERRY
       53  Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they
       54  that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
       55  way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
       56  show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
    VERGES
       57  You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
    DOGBERRY
       58  Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
       59  a man who hath any honesty in him.
    VERGES
       60  If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call
       61  to the nurse and bid her still it.
    Watchman
       62  How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
    DOGBERRY
       63  Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake
       64  her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
       65  lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.
    VERGES
       66  'Tis very true.
    DOGBERRY
       67  This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
       68  to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
       69  prince in the night, you may stay him.
    VERGES
       70  Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.
    DOGBERRY
       71  Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows
       72  the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
       73  the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
       74  to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
       75  man against his will.
    VERGES
       76  By'r lady, I think it be so.
    DOGBERRY
       77  Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be
       78  any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
       79  fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
       80  Come, neighbour.
    Watchman
       81  Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
       82  upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.
    DOGBERRY
       83  One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch
       84  about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being
       85  there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
       86  Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.
  Direction: Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES
  Direction: Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE
    BORACHIO
       87  What Conrade!
    Watchman
  Direction: Aside
       88  Peace! stir not.
    BORACHIO
       89  Conrade, I say!
    CONRADE
       90  Here, man; I am at thy elbow.
    BORACHIO
       91  Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a
       92  scab follow.
    CONRADE
       93  I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward
       94  with thy tale.
    BORACHIO
       95  Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for
       96  it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,
       97  utter all to thee.
    Watchman
  Direction: Aside
       98  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.
    BORACHIO
       99  Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
    CONRADE
      100  Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
    BORACHIO
      101  Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
      102  villany should be so rich; for when rich villains
      103  have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
      104  price they will.
    CONRADE
      105  I wonder at it.
    BORACHIO
      106  That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
      107  the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is
      108  nothing to a man.
    CONRADE
      109  Yes, it is apparel.
    BORACHIO
      110  I mean, the fashion.
    CONRADE
      111  Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
    BORACHIO
      112  Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
      113  seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
      114  is?
    Watchman
  Direction: Aside
      115  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile
      116  thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a
      117  gentleman: I remember his name.
    BORACHIO
      118  Didst thou not hear somebody?
    CONRADE
      119  No; 'twas the vane on the house.
    BORACHIO
      120  Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
      121  fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
      122  bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
      123  sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
      124  in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
      125  priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
      126  shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
      127  where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
    CONRADE
      128  All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
      129  out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
      130  thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
      131  shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
    BORACHIO
      132  Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
      133  wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
      134  name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
      135  chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
      136  night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
      137  tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
      138  planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
      139  John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
    CONRADE
      140  And thought they Margaret was Hero?
    BORACHIO
      141  Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the
      142  devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
      143  by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
      144  the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
      145  by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
      146  Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
      147  he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
      148  at the temple, and there, before the whole
      149  congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
      150  and send her home again without a husband.
    First Watchman
      151  We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!
    Second Watchman
      152  Call up the right master constable. We have here
      153  recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
      154  ever was known in the commonwealth.
    First Watchman
      155  And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'
      156  wears a lock.
    CONRADE
      157  Masters, masters,--
    Second Watchman
      158  You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.
    CONRADE
      159  Masters,--
    First Watchman
      160  Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.
    BORACHIO
      161  We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken
      162  up of these men's bills.
    CONRADE
      163  A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.
