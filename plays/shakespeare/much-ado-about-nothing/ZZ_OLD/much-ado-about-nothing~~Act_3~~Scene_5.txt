          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 3 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Another room in LEONATO'S house.
  Direction: Enter LEONATO, with DOGBERRY and VERGES
    LEONATO
        1  What would you with me, honest neighbour?
    DOGBERRY
        2  Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you
        3  that decerns you nearly.
    LEONATO
        4  Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.
    DOGBERRY
        5  Marry, this it is, sir.
    VERGES
        6  Yes, in truth it is, sir.
    LEONATO
        7  What is it, my good friends?
    DOGBERRY
        8  Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the
        9  matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so
       10  blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,
       11  in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
    VERGES
       12  Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living
       13  that is an old man and no honester than I.
    DOGBERRY
       14  Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
    LEONATO
       15  Neighbours, you are tedious.
    DOGBERRY
       16  It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the
       17  poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,
       18  if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in
       19  my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
    LEONATO
       20  All thy tediousness on me, ah?
    DOGBERRY
       21  Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for
       22  I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any
       23  man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I
       24  am glad to hear it.
    VERGES
       25  And so am I.
    LEONATO
       26  I would fain know what you have to say.
    VERGES
       27  Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your
       28  worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant
       29  knaves as any in Messina.
    DOGBERRY
       30  A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they
       31  say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help
       32  us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,
       33  neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men
       34  ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest
       35  soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever
       36  broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men
       37  are not alike; alas, good neighbour!
    LEONATO
       38  Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.
    DOGBERRY
       39  Gifts that God gives.
    LEONATO
       40  I must leave you.
    DOGBERRY
       41  One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
       42  comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would
       43  have them this morning examined before your worship.
    LEONATO
       44  Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I
       45  am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.
    DOGBERRY
       46  It shall be suffigance.
    LEONATO
       47  Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
    Messenger
       48  My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to
       49  her husband.
    LEONATO
       50  I'll wait upon them: I am ready.
  Direction: Exeunt LEONATO and Messenger
    DOGBERRY
       51  Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;
       52  bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we
       53  are now to examination these men.
    VERGES
       54  And we must do it wisely.
    DOGBERRY
       55  We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's
       56  that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only
       57  get the learned writer to set down our
       58  excommunication and meet me at the gaol.
  Direction: Exeunt
