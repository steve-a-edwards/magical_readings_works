          Much Ado About Nothing : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.
  Direction: Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger
    LEONATO
        1  I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
        2  comes this night to Messina.
    Messenger
        3  He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
        4  when I left him.
    LEONATO
        5  How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
    Messenger
        6  But few of any sort, and none of name.
    LEONATO
        7  A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
        8  home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
        9  bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
    Messenger
       10  Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
       11  Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
       12  promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
       13  the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
       14  bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
       15  tell you how.
    LEONATO
       16  He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
       17  glad of it.
    Messenger
       18  I have already delivered him letters, and there
       19  appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
       20  not show itself modest enough without a badge of
       21  bitterness.
    LEONATO
       22  Did he break out into tears?
    Messenger
       23  In great measure.
    LEONATO
       24  A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
       25  truer than those that are so washed. How much
       26  better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
    BEATRICE
       27  I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
       28  wars or no?
    Messenger
       29  I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
       30  in the army of any sort.
    LEONATO
       31  What is he that you ask for, niece?
    HERO
       32  My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
    Messenger
       33  O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.
    BEATRICE
       34  He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
       35  Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
       36  the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
       37  him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
       38  killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
       39  he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
    LEONATO
       40  Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
       41  but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
    Messenger
       42  He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
    BEATRICE
       43  You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
       44  he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
       45  excellent stomach.
    Messenger
       46  And a good soldier too, lady.
    BEATRICE
       47  And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
    Messenger
       48  A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
       49  honourable virtues.
    BEATRICE
       50  It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
       51  but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.
    LEONATO
       52  You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
       53  kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
       54  they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
       55  between them.
    BEATRICE
       56  Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
       57  conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
       58  now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
       59  he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
       60  bear it for a difference between himself and his
       61  horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
       62  to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
       63  companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
    Messenger
       64  Is't possible?
    BEATRICE
       65  Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
       66  the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
       67  next block.
    Messenger
       68  I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
    BEATRICE
       69  No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
       70  you, who is his companion? Is there no young
       71  squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
    Messenger
       72  He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
    BEATRICE
       73  O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
       74  is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
       75  runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
       76  he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
       77  thousand pound ere a' be cured.
    Messenger
       78  I will hold friends with you, lady.
    BEATRICE
       79  Do, good friend.
    LEONATO
       80  You will never run mad, niece.
    BEATRICE
       81  No, not till a hot January.
    Messenger
       82  Don Pedro is approached.
  Direction: Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR
    DON PEDRO
       83  Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
       84  trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
       85  cost, and you encounter it.
    LEONATO
       86  Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
       87  your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
       88  remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
       89  and happiness takes his leave.
    DON PEDRO
       90  You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
       91  is your daughter.
    LEONATO
       92  Her mother hath many times told me so.
    BENEDICK
       93  Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
    LEONATO
       94  Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
    DON PEDRO
       95  You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
       96  what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
       97  herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
       98  honourable father.
    BENEDICK
       99  If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
      100  have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
      101  like him as she is.
    BEATRICE
      102  I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
      103  Benedick: nobody marks you.
    BENEDICK
      104  What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?
    BEATRICE
      105  Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
      106  such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
      107  Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
      108  in her presence.
    BENEDICK
      109  Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
      110  am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
      111  would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
      112  heart; for, truly, I love none.
    BEATRICE
      113  A dear happiness to women: they would else have
      114  been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
      115  and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
      116  had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
      117  swear he loves me.
    BENEDICK
      118  God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
      119  gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
      120  scratched face.
    BEATRICE
      121  Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
      122  a face as yours were.
    BENEDICK
      123  Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
    BEATRICE
      124  A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
    BENEDICK
      125  I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
      126  so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
      127  name; I have done.
    BEATRICE
      128  You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
    DON PEDRO
      129  That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
      130  and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
      131  invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
      132  the least a month; and he heartily prays some
      133  occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
      134  hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
    LEONATO
      135  If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
  Direction: To DON JOHN
      136  Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
      137  the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
    DON JOHN
      138  I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
      139  you.
    LEONATO
      140  Please it your grace lead on?
    DON PEDRO
      141  Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
  Direction: Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO
    CLAUDIO
      142  Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
    BENEDICK
      143  I noted her not; but I looked on her.
    CLAUDIO
      144  Is she not a modest young lady?
    BENEDICK
      145  Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
      146  my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
      147  after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
    CLAUDIO
      148  No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
    BENEDICK
      149  Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
      150  praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
      151  for a great praise: only this commendation I can
      152  afford her, that were she other than she is, she
      153  were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
      154  do not like her.
    CLAUDIO
      155  Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
      156  truly how thou likest her.
    BENEDICK
      157  Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
    CLAUDIO
      158  Can the world buy such a jewel?
    BENEDICK
      159  Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
      160  with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
      161  to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
      162  rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
      163  you, to go in the song?
    CLAUDIO
      164  In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
      165  looked on.
    BENEDICK
      166  I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
      167  matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
      168  possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
      169  as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
      170  hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
    CLAUDIO
      171  I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
      172  contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
    BENEDICK
      173  Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
      174  one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
      175  Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
      176  Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
      177  into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
      178  Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
  Direction: Re-enter DON PEDRO
    DON PEDRO
      179  What secret hath held you here, that you followed
      180  not to Leonato's?
    BENEDICK
      181  I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
    DON PEDRO
      182  I charge thee on thy allegiance.
    BENEDICK
      183  You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
      184  man; I would have you think so; but, on my
      185  allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
      186  in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
      187  Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's
      188  short daughter.
    CLAUDIO
      189  If this were so, so were it uttered.
    BENEDICK
      190  Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
      191  'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
      192  so.'
    CLAUDIO
      193  If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
      194  should be otherwise.
    DON PEDRO
      195  Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
    CLAUDIO
      196  You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
    DON PEDRO
      197  By my troth, I speak my thought.
    CLAUDIO
      198  And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
    BENEDICK
      199  And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
    CLAUDIO
      200  That I love her, I feel.
    DON PEDRO
      201  That she is worthy, I know.
    BENEDICK
      202  That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
      203  know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
      204  fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
    DON PEDRO
      205  Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
      206  of beauty.
    CLAUDIO
      207  And never could maintain his part but in the force
      208  of his will.
    BENEDICK
      209  That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she
      210  brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
      211  thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
      212  forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
      213  all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
      214  them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
      215  right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
      216  I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
    DON PEDRO
      217  I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
    BENEDICK
      218  With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
      219  not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
      220  with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
      221  out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
      222  up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
      223  blind Cupid.
    DON PEDRO
      224  Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
      225  wilt prove a notable argument.
    BENEDICK
      226  If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
      227  at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
      228  the shoulder, and called Adam.
    DON PEDRO
      229  Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
      230  doth bear the yoke.'
    BENEDICK
      231  The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
      232  Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
      233  them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
      234  and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
      235  good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
      236  'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
    CLAUDIO
      237  If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
    DON PEDRO
      238  Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
      239  Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
    BENEDICK
      240  I look for an earthquake too, then.
    DON PEDRO
      241  Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
      242  meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
      243  Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
      244  not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
      245  great preparation.
    BENEDICK
      246  I have almost matter enough in me for such an
      247  embassage; and so I commit you--
    CLAUDIO
      248  To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--
    DON PEDRO
      249  The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.
    BENEDICK
      250  Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
      251  discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
      252  the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
      253  you flout old ends any further, examine your
      254  conscience: and so I leave you.
  Direction: Exit
    CLAUDIO
      255  My liege, your highness now may do me good.
    DON PEDRO
      256  My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
      257  And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
      258  Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
    CLAUDIO
      259  Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
    DON PEDRO
      260  No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
      261  Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
    CLAUDIO
      262  O, my lord,
      263  When you went onward on this ended action,
      264  I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
      265  That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
      266  Than to drive liking to the name of love:
      267  But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
      268  Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
      269  Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
      270  All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
      271  Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
    DON PEDRO
      272  Thou wilt be like a lover presently
      273  And tire the hearer with a book of words.
      274  If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
      275  And I will break with her and with her father,
      276  And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
      277  That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
    CLAUDIO
      278  How sweetly you do minister to love,
      279  That know love's grief by his complexion!
      280  But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
      281  I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
    DON PEDRO
      282  What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
      283  The fairest grant is the necessity.
      284  Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
      285  And I will fit thee with the remedy.
      286  I know we shall have revelling to-night:
      287  I will assume thy part in some disguise
      288  And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
      289  And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
      290  And take her hearing prisoner with the force
      291  And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
      292  Then after to her father will I break;
      293  And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
      294  In practise let us put it presently.
  Direction: Exeunt
