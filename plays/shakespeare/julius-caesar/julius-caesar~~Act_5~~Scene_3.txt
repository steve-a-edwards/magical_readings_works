          Julius Caesar : Act 5 : Scene 3

SCENE III. Another part of the field.
  Direction: Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS
    CASSIUS
        1  O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
        2  Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
        3  This ensign here of mine was turning back;
        4  I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
    TITINIUS
        5  O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
        6  Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
        7  Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
        8  Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
  Direction: Enter PINDARUS
    PINDARUS
        9  Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
       10  Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
       11  Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
    CASSIUS
       12  This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
       13  Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
    TITINIUS
       14  They are, my lord.
    CASSIUS
       15  Titinius, if thou lovest me,
       16  Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
       17  Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
       18  And here again; that I may rest assured
       19  Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
    TITINIUS
       20  I will be here again, even with a thought.
  Direction: Exit
    CASSIUS
       21  Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
       22  My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
       23  And tell me what thou notest about the field.
  Direction: PINDARUS ascends the hill
       24  This day I breathed first: time is come round,
       25  And where I did begin, there shall I end;
       26  My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?
    PINDARUS
       27  [Above] O my lord!
    CASSIUS
       28  What news?
    PINDARUS
       29  [Above] Titinius is enclosed round about
       30  With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
       31  Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
       32  Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
       33  He's ta'en.
  Direction: Shout
       34  And, hark! they shout for joy.
    CASSIUS
       35  Come down, behold no more.
       36  O, coward that I am, to live so long,
       37  To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
  Direction: PINDARUS descends
       38  Come hither, sirrah:
       39  In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
       40  And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
       41  That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
       42  Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
       43  Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
       44  That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
       45  Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
       46  And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
       47  Guide thou the sword.
  Direction: PINDARUS stabs him
       48  Caesar, thou art revenged,
       49  Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
  Direction: Dies
    PINDARUS
       50  So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
       51  Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
       52  Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
       53  Where never Roman shall take note of him.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA
    MESSALA
       54  It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
       55  Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
       56  As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
    TITINIUS
       57  These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
    MESSALA
       58  Where did you leave him?
    TITINIUS
       59  All disconsolate,
       60  With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
    MESSALA
       61  Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?
    TITINIUS
       62  He lies not like the living. O my heart!
    MESSALA
       63  Is not that he?
    TITINIUS
       64  No, this was he, Messala,
       65  But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
       66  As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
       67  So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
       68  The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
       69  Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
       70  Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
    MESSALA
       71  Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
       72  O hateful error, melancholy's child,
       73  Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
       74  The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
       75  Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
       76  But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
    TITINIUS
       77  What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?
    MESSALA
       78  Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
       79  The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
       80  Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
       81  For piercing steel and darts envenomed
       82  Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
       83  As tidings of this sight.
    TITINIUS
       84  Hie you, Messala,
       85  And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
  Direction: Exit MESSALA
       86  Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
       87  Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
       88  Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
       89  And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
       90  Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
       91  But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
       92  Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
       93  Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
       94  And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
       95  By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part
       96  Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
  Direction: Kills himself
  Direction: Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS
    BRUTUS
       97  Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
    MESSALA
       98  Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
    BRUTUS
       99  Titinius' face is upward.
    CATO
      100  He is slain.
    BRUTUS
      101  O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
      102  Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
      103  In our own proper entrails.
  Direction: Low alarums
    CATO
      104  Brave Titinius!
      105  Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
    BRUTUS
      106  Are yet two Romans living such as these?
      107  The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
      108  It is impossible that ever Rome
      109  Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
      110  To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
      111  I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
      112  Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
      113  His funerals shall not be in our camp,
      114  Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
      115  And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
      116  Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
      117  'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
      118  We shall try fortune in a second fight.
  Direction: Exeunt
