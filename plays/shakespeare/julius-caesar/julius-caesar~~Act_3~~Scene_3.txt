          Julius Caesar : Act 3 : Scene 3

SCENE III. A street.
  Direction: Enter CINNA the poet
    CINNA THE POET
        1  I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
        2  And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
        3  I have no will to wander forth of doors,
        4  Yet something leads me forth.
  Direction: Enter Citizens
    First Citizen
        5  What is your name?
    Second Citizen
        6  Whither are you going?
    Third Citizen
        7  Where do you dwell?
    Fourth Citizen
        8  Are you a married man or a bachelor?
    Second Citizen
        9  Answer every man directly.
    First Citizen
       10  Ay, and briefly.
    Fourth Citizen
       11  Ay, and wisely.
    Third Citizen
       12  Ay, and truly, you were best.
    CINNA THE POET
       13  What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
       14  dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
       15  answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
       16  truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
    Second Citizen
       17  That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:
       18  you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.
    CINNA THE POET
       19  Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
    First Citizen
       20  As a friend or an enemy?
    CINNA THE POET
       21  As a friend.
    Second Citizen
       22  That matter is answered directly.
    Fourth Citizen
       23  For your dwelling,--briefly.
    CINNA THE POET
       24  Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
    Third Citizen
       25  Your name, sir, truly.
    CINNA THE POET
       26  Truly, my name is Cinna.
    First Citizen
       27  Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.
    CINNA THE POET
       28  I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
    Fourth Citizen
       29  Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
    CINNA THE POET
       30  I am not Cinna the conspirator.
    Fourth Citizen
       31  It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his
       32  name out of his heart, and turn him going.
    Third Citizen
       33  Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:
       34  to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'
       35  house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go!
  Direction: Exeunt
