          Julius Caesar : Act 2 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.
  Direction: Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS
    PORTIA
        1  I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;
        2  Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
        3  Why dost thou stay?
    LUCIUS
        4  To know my errand, madam.
    PORTIA
        5  I would have had thee there, and here again,
        6  Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
        7  O constancy, be strong upon my side,
        8  Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
        9  I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
       10  How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
       11  Art thou here yet?
    LUCIUS
       12  Madam, what should I do?
       13  Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
       14  And so return to you, and nothing else?
    PORTIA
       15  Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
       16  For he went sickly forth: and take good note
       17  What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
       18  Hark, boy! what noise is that?
    LUCIUS
       19  I hear none, madam.
    PORTIA
       20  Prithee, listen well;
       21  I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
       22  And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
    LUCIUS
       23  Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
  Direction: Enter the Soothsayer
    PORTIA
       24  Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?
    Soothsayer
       25  At mine own house, good lady.
    PORTIA
       26  What is't o'clock?
    Soothsayer
       27  About the ninth hour, lady.
    PORTIA
       28  Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
    Soothsayer
       29  Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
       30  To see him pass on to the Capitol.
    PORTIA
       31  Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
    Soothsayer
       32  That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
       33  To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
       34  I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
    PORTIA
       35  Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
    Soothsayer
       36  None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
       37  Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
       38  The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
       39  Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
       40  Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
       41  I'll get me to a place more void, and there
       42  Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
  Direction: Exit
    PORTIA
       43  I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
       44  The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
       45  The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
       46  Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
       47  That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
       48  Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
       49  Say I am merry: come to me again,
       50  And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
  Direction: Exeunt severally
