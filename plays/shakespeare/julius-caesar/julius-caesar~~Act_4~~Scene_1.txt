          Julius Caesar : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A house in Rome.
  Direction: ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table
    ANTONY
        1  These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.
    OCTAVIUS
        2  Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
    LEPIDUS
        3  I do consent--
    OCTAVIUS
        4  Prick him down, Antony.
    LEPIDUS
        5  Upon condition Publius shall not live,
        6  Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
    ANTONY
        7  He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
        8  But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
        9  Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
       10  How to cut off some charge in legacies.
    LEPIDUS
       11  What, shall I find you here?
    OCTAVIUS
       12  Or here, or at the Capitol.
  Direction: Exit LEPIDUS
    ANTONY
       13  This is a slight unmeritable man,
       14  Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
       15  The three-fold world divided, he should stand
       16  One of the three to share it?
    OCTAVIUS
       17  So you thought him;
       18  And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
       19  In our black sentence and proscription.
    ANTONY
       20  Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
       21  And though we lay these honours on this man,
       22  To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
       23  He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
       24  To groan and sweat under the business,
       25  Either led or driven, as we point the way;
       26  And having brought our treasure where we will,
       27  Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
       28  Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
       29  And graze in commons.
    OCTAVIUS
       30  You may do your will;
       31  But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
    ANTONY
       32  So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
       33  I do appoint him store of provender:
       34  It is a creature that I teach to fight,
       35  To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
       36  His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
       37  And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
       38  He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
       39  A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
       40  On abjects, orts and imitations,
       41  Which, out of use and staled by other men,
       42  Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
       43  But as a property. And now, Octavius,
       44  Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
       45  Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
       46  Therefore let our alliance be combined,
       47  Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
       48  And let us presently go sit in council,
       49  How covert matters may be best disclosed,
       50  And open perils surest answered.
    OCTAVIUS
       51  Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
       52  And bay'd about with many enemies;
       53  And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
       54  Millions of mischiefs.
  Direction: Exeunt
