          Julius Caesar : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. CAESAR's house.
  Direction: Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown
    CAESAR
        1  Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
        2  Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
        3  'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?
  Direction: Enter a Servant
    Servant
        4  My lord?
    CAESAR
        5  Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
        6  And bring me their opinions of success.
    Servant
        7  I will, my lord.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter CALPURNIA
    CALPURNIA
        8  What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?
        9  You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
    CAESAR
       10  Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
       11  Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
       12  The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
    CALPURNIA
       13  Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
       14  Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
       15  Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
       16  Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
       17  A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
       18  And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
       19  Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
       20  In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
       21  Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
       22  The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
       23  Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
       24  And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
       25  O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
       26  And I do fear them.
    CAESAR
       27  What can be avoided
       28  Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
       29  Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
       30  Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
    CALPURNIA
       31  When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
       32  The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
    CAESAR
       33  Cowards die many times before their deaths;
       34  The valiant never taste of death but once.
       35  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
       36  It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
       37  Seeing that death, a necessary end,
       38  Will come when it will come.
  Direction: Re-enter Servant
       39  What say the augurers?
    Servant
       40  They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
       41  Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
       42  They could not find a heart within the beast.
    CAESAR
       43  The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
       44  Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
       45  If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
       46  No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
       47  That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
       48  We are two lions litter'd in one day,
       49  And I the elder and more terrible:
       50  And Caesar shall go forth.
    CALPURNIA
       51  Alas, my lord,
       52  Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
       53  Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
       54  That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
       55  We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
       56  And he shall say you are not well to-day:
       57  Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
    CAESAR
       58  Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
       59  And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
  Direction: Enter DECIUS BRUTUS
       60  Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
    DECIUS BRUTUS
       61  Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:
       62  I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
    CAESAR
       63  And you are come in very happy time,
       64  To bear my greeting to the senators
       65  And tell them that I will not come to-day:
       66  Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
       67  I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.
    CALPURNIA
       68  Say he is sick.
    CAESAR
       69  Shall Caesar send a lie?
       70  Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
       71  To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
       72  Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
    DECIUS BRUTUS
       73  Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
       74  Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
    CAESAR
       75  The cause is in my will: I will not come;
       76  That is enough to satisfy the senate.
       77  But for your private satisfaction,
       78  Because I love you, I will let you know:
       79  Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
       80  She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
       81  Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
       82  Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
       83  Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
       84  And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
       85  And evils imminent; and on her knee
       86  Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
    DECIUS BRUTUS
       87  This dream is all amiss interpreted;
       88  It was a vision fair and fortunate:
       89  Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
       90  In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
       91  Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
       92  Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
       93  For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
       94  This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
    CAESAR
       95  And this way have you well expounded it.
    DECIUS BRUTUS
       96  I have, when you have heard what I can say:
       97  And know it now: the senate have concluded
       98  To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
       99  If you shall send them word you will not come,
      100  Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
      101  Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
      102  'Break up the senate till another time,
      103  When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
      104  If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
      105  'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
      106  Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
      107  To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
      108  And reason to my love is liable.
    CAESAR
      109  How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
      110  I am ashamed I did yield to them.
      111  Give me my robe, for I will go.
  Direction: Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA
      112  And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
    PUBLIUS
      113  Good morrow, Caesar.
    CAESAR
      114  Welcome, Publius.
      115  What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
      116  Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
      117  Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
      118  As that same ague which hath made you lean.
      119  What is 't o'clock?
    BRUTUS
      120  Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
    CAESAR
      121  I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
  Direction: Enter ANTONY
      122  See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
      123  Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.
    ANTONY
      124  So to most noble Caesar.
    CAESAR
      125  Bid them prepare within:
      126  I am to blame to be thus waited for.
      127  Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
      128  I have an hour's talk in store for you;
      129  Remember that you call on me to-day:
      130  Be near me, that I may remember you.
    TREBONIUS
      131  Caesar, I will:
  Direction: Aside
      132  and so near will I be,
      133  That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
    CAESAR
      134  Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
      135  And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
    BRUTUS
      136  [Aside] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
      137  The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!
  Direction: Exeunt
