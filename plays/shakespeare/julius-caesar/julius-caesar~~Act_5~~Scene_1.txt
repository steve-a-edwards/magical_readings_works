          Julius Caesar : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army
    OCTAVIUS
        1  Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:
        2  You said the enemy would not come down,
        3  But keep the hills and upper regions;
        4  It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
        5  They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
        6  Answering before we do demand of them.
    ANTONY
        7  Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
        8  Wherefore they do it: they could be content
        9  To visit other places; and come down
       10  With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
       11  To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
       12  But 'tis not so.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
    Messenger
       13  Prepare you, generals:
       14  The enemy comes on in gallant show;
       15  Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
       16  And something to be done immediately.
    ANTONY
       17  Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
       18  Upon the left hand of the even field.
    OCTAVIUS
       19  Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
    ANTONY
       20  Why do you cross me in this exigent?
    OCTAVIUS
       21  I do not cross you; but I will do so.
  Direction: March
  Direction: Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army; LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others
    BRUTUS
       22  They stand, and would have parley.
    CASSIUS
       23  Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.
    OCTAVIUS
       24  Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
    ANTONY
       25  No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
       26  Make forth; the generals would have some words.
    OCTAVIUS
       27  Stir not until the signal.
    BRUTUS
       28  Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?
    OCTAVIUS
       29  Not that we love words better, as you do.
    BRUTUS
       30  Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
    ANTONY
       31  In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
       32  Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
       33  Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'
    CASSIUS
       34  Antony,
       35  The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
       36  But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
       37  And leave them honeyless.
    ANTONY
       38  Not stingless too.
    BRUTUS
       39  O, yes, and soundless too;
       40  For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
       41  And very wisely threat before you sting.
    ANTONY
       42  Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
       43  Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
       44  You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
       45  And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
       46  Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
       47  Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
    CASSIUS
       48  Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
       49  This tongue had not offended so to-day,
       50  If Cassius might have ruled.
    OCTAVIUS
       51  Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,
       52  The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;
       53  I draw a sword against conspirators;
       54  When think you that the sword goes up again?
       55  Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
       56  Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
       57  Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
    BRUTUS
       58  Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
       59  Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
    OCTAVIUS
       60  So I hope;
       61  I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
    BRUTUS
       62  O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
       63  Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.
    CASSIUS
       64  A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
       65  Join'd with a masker and a reveller!
    ANTONY
       66  Old Cassius still!
    OCTAVIUS
       67  Come, Antony, away!
       68  Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
       69  If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
       70  If not, when you have stomachs.
  Direction: Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army
    CASSIUS
       71  Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
       72  The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
    BRUTUS
       73  Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.
    LUCILIUS
       74  [Standing forth] My lord?
  Direction: BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart
    CASSIUS
       75  Messala!
    MESSALA
       76  [Standing forth] What says my general?
    CASSIUS
       77  Messala,
       78  This is my birth-day; as this very day
       79  Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
       80  Be thou my witness that against my will,
       81  As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
       82  Upon one battle all our liberties.
       83  You know that I held Epicurus strong
       84  And his opinion: now I change my mind,
       85  And partly credit things that do presage.
       86  Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
       87  Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
       88  Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
       89  Who to Philippi here consorted us:
       90  This morning are they fled away and gone;
       91  And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
       92  Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
       93  As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
       94  A canopy most fatal, under which
       95  Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
    MESSALA
       96  Believe not so.
    CASSIUS
       97  I but believe it partly;
       98  For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
       99  To meet all perils very constantly.
    BRUTUS
      100  Even so, Lucilius.
    CASSIUS
      101  Now, most noble Brutus,
      102  The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
      103  Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
      104  But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
      105  Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
      106  If we do lose this battle, then is this
      107  The very last time we shall speak together:
      108  What are you then determined to do?
    BRUTUS
      109  Even by the rule of that philosophy
      110  By which I did blame Cato for the death
      111  Which he did give himself, I know not how,
      112  But I do find it cowardly and vile,
      113  For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
      114  The time of life: arming myself with patience
      115  To stay the providence of some high powers
      116  That govern us below.
    CASSIUS
      117  Then, if we lose this battle,
      118  You are contented to be led in triumph
      119  Thorough the streets of Rome?
    BRUTUS
      120  No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
      121  That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
      122  He bears too great a mind. But this same day
      123  Must end that work the ides of March begun;
      124  And whether we shall meet again I know not.
      125  Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
      126  For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
      127  If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
      128  If not, why then, this parting was well made.
    CASSIUS
      129  For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
      130  If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
      131  If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
    BRUTUS
      132  Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
      133  The end of this day's business ere it come!
      134  But it sufficeth that the day will end,
      135  And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!
  Direction: Exeunt
