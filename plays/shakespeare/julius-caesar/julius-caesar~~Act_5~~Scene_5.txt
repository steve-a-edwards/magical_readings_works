          Julius Caesar : Act 5 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Another part of the field.
  Direction: Enter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and VOLUMNIUS
    BRUTUS
        1  Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
    CLITUS
        2  Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
        3  He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.
    BRUTUS
        4  Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
        5  It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
  Direction: Whispers
    CLITUS
        6  What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
    BRUTUS
        7  Peace then! no words.
    CLITUS
        8  I'll rather kill myself.
    BRUTUS
        9  Hark thee, Dardanius.
  Direction: Whispers
    DARDANIUS
       10  Shall I do such a deed?
    CLITUS
       11  O Dardanius!
    DARDANIUS
       12  O Clitus!
    CLITUS
       13  What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
    DARDANIUS
       14  To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
    CLITUS
       15  Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
       16  That it runs over even at his eyes.
    BRUTUS
       17  Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.
    VOLUMNIUS
       18  What says my lord?
    BRUTUS
       19  Why, this, Volumnius:
       20  The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
       21  Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
       22  And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
       23  I know my hour is come.
    VOLUMNIUS
       24  Not so, my lord.
    BRUTUS
       25  Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
       26  Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
       27  Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
  Direction: Low alarums
       28  It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
       29  Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
       30  Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
       31  Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
       32  Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
    VOLUMNIUS
       33  That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
  Direction: Alarum still
    CLITUS
       34  Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.
    BRUTUS
       35  Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
       36  Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
       37  Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
       38  My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
       39  I found no man but he was true to me.
       40  I shall have glory by this losing day
       41  More than Octavius and Mark Antony
       42  By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
       43  So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
       44  Hath almost ended his life's history:
       45  Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
       46  That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
  Direction: Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'
    CLITUS
       47  Fly, my lord, fly.
    BRUTUS
       48  Hence! I will follow.
  Direction: Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS
       49  I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
       50  Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
       51  Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
       52  Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
       53  While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
    STRATO
       54  Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
    BRUTUS
       55  Farewell, good Strato.
  Direction: Runs on his sword
       56  Caesar, now be still:
       57  I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
  Direction: Dies
  Direction: Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA, LUCILIUS, and the army
    OCTAVIUS
       58  What man is that?
    MESSALA
       59  My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
    STRATO
       60  Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
       61  The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
       62  For Brutus only overcame himself,
       63  And no man else hath honour by his death.
    LUCILIUS
       64  So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
       65  That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
    OCTAVIUS
       66  All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
       67  Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
    STRATO
       68  Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
    OCTAVIUS
       69  Do so, good Messala.
    MESSALA
       70  How died my master, Strato?
    STRATO
       71  I held the sword, and he did run on it.
    MESSALA
       72  Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
       73  That did the latest service to my master.
    ANTONY
       74  This was the noblest Roman of them all:
       75  All the conspirators save only he
       76  Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
       77  He only, in a general honest thought
       78  And common good to all, made one of them.
       79  His life was gentle, and the elements
       80  So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
       81  And say to all the world 'This was a man!'
    OCTAVIUS
       82  According to his virtue let us use him,
       83  With all respect and rites of burial.
       84  Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
       85  Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
       86  So call the field to rest; and let's away,
       87  To part the glories of this happy day.
  Direction: Exeunt
