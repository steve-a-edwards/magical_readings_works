          Julius Caesar : Act 5 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
  Direction: Alarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others
    BRUTUS
        1  Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
    CATO
        2  What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
        3  I will proclaim my name about the field:
        4  I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
        5  A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
        6  I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
    BRUTUS
        7  And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
        8  Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
  Direction: Exit
    LUCILIUS
        9  O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
       10  Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;
       11  And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.
    First Soldier
       12  Yield, or thou diest.
    LUCILIUS
       13  Only I yield to die:
       14  There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;
  Direction: Offering money
       15  Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
    First Soldier
       16  We must not. A noble prisoner!
    Second Soldier
       17  Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
    First Soldier
       18  I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
  Direction: Enter ANTONY
       19  Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
    ANTONY
       20  Where is he?
    LUCILIUS
       21  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
       22  I dare assure thee that no enemy
       23  Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
       24  The gods defend him from so great a shame!
       25  When you do find him, or alive or dead,
       26  He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
    ANTONY
       27  This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
       28  A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
       29  Give him all kindness: I had rather have
       30  Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
       31  And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
       32  And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
       33  How every thing is chanced.
  Direction: Exeunt
