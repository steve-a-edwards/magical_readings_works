          Julius Caesar : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A public place.
  Direction: Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course; CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer
    CAESAR
        1  Calpurnia!
    CASCA
        2  Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
    CAESAR
        3  Calpurnia!
    CALPURNIA
        4  Here, my lord.
    CAESAR
        5  Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
        6  When he doth run his course. Antonius!
    ANTONY
        7  Caesar, my lord?
    CAESAR
        8  Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
        9  To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
       10  The barren, touched in this holy chase,
       11  Shake off their sterile curse.
    ANTONY
       12  I shall remember:
       13  When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.
    CAESAR
       14  Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
  Direction: Flourish
    Soothsayer
       15  Caesar!
    CAESAR
       16  Ha! who calls?
    CASCA
       17  Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
    CAESAR
       18  Who is it in the press that calls on me?
       19  I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
       20  Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.
    Soothsayer
       21  Beware the ides of March.
    CAESAR
       22  What man is that?
    BRUTUS
       23  A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
    CAESAR
       24  Set him before me; let me see his face.
    CASSIUS
       25  Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
    CAESAR
       26  What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.
    Soothsayer
       27  Beware the ides of March.
    CAESAR
       28  He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
  Direction: Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS
    CASSIUS
       29  Will you go see the order of the course?
    BRUTUS
       30  Not I.
    CASSIUS
       31  I pray you, do.
    BRUTUS
       32  I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
       33  Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
       34  Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
       35  I'll leave you.
    CASSIUS
       36  Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
       37  I have not from your eyes that gentleness
       38  And show of love as I was wont to have:
       39  You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
       40  Over your friend that loves you.
    BRUTUS
       41  Cassius,
       42  Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
       43  I turn the trouble of my countenance
       44  Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
       45  Of late with passions of some difference,
       46  Conceptions only proper to myself,
       47  Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
       48  But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
       49  Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
       50  Nor construe any further my neglect,
       51  Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
       52  Forgets the shows of love to other men.
    CASSIUS
       53  Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
       54  By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
       55  Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
       56  Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
    BRUTUS
       57  No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
       58  But by reflection, by some other things.
    CASSIUS
       59  'Tis just:
       60  And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
       61  That you have no such mirrors as will turn
       62  Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
       63  That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
       64  Where many of the best respect in Rome,
       65  Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
       66  And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
       67  Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
    BRUTUS
       68  Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
       69  That you would have me seek into myself
       70  For that which is not in me?
    CASSIUS
       71  Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
       72  And since you know you cannot see yourself
       73  So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
       74  Will modestly discover to yourself
       75  That of yourself which you yet know not of.
       76  And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
       77  Were I a common laugher, or did use
       78  To stale with ordinary oaths my love
       79  To every new protester; if you know
       80  That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
       81  And after scandal them, or if you know
       82  That I profess myself in banqueting
       83  To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
  Direction: Flourish, and shout
    BRUTUS
       84  What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
       85  Choose Caesar for their king.
    CASSIUS
       86  Ay, do you fear it?
       87  Then must I think you would not have it so.
    BRUTUS
       88  I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
       89  But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
       90  What is it that you would impart to me?
       91  If it be aught toward the general good,
       92  Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
       93  And I will look on both indifferently,
       94  For let the gods so speed me as I love
       95  The name of honour more than I fear death.
    CASSIUS
       96  I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
       97  As well as I do know your outward favour.
       98  Well, honour is the subject of my story.
       99  I cannot tell what you and other men
      100  Think of this life; but, for my single self,
      101  I had as lief not be as live to be
      102  In awe of such a thing as I myself.
      103  I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
      104  We both have fed as well, and we can both
      105  Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
      106  For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
      107  The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
      108  Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
      109  Leap in with me into this angry flood,
      110  And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
      111  Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
      112  And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
      113  The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
      114  With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
      115  And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
      116  But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
      117  Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
      118  I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
      119  Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
      120  The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
      121  Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
      122  Is now become a god, and Cassius is
      123  A wretched creature and must bend his body,
      124  If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
      125  He had a fever when he was in Spain,
      126  And when the fit was on him, I did mark
      127  How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
      128  His coward lips did from their colour fly,
      129  And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
      130  Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
      131  Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
      132  Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
      133  Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
      134  As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
      135  A man of such a feeble temper should
      136  So get the start of the majestic world
      137  And bear the palm alone.
  Direction: Shout. Flourish
    BRUTUS
      138  Another general shout!
      139  I do believe that these applauses are
      140  For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
    CASSIUS
      141  Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
      142  Like a Colossus, and we petty men
      143  Walk under his huge legs and peep about
      144  To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
      145  Men at some time are masters of their fates:
      146  The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
      147  But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
      148  Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
      149  Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
      150  Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
      151  Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
      152  Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
      153  Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
      154  Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
      155  Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
      156  That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
      157  Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
      158  When went there by an age, since the great flood,
      159  But it was famed with more than with one man?
      160  When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
      161  That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
      162  Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
      163  When there is in it but one only man.
      164  O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
      165  There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
      166  The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
      167  As easily as a king.
    BRUTUS
      168  That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
      169  What you would work me to, I have some aim:
      170  How I have thought of this and of these times,
      171  I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
      172  I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
      173  Be any further moved. What you have said
      174  I will consider; what you have to say
      175  I will with patience hear, and find a time
      176  Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
      177  Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
      178  Brutus had rather be a villager
      179  Than to repute himself a son of Rome
      180  Under these hard conditions as this time
      181  Is like to lay upon us.
    CASSIUS
      182  I am glad that my weak words
      183  Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
    BRUTUS
      184  The games are done and Caesar is returning.
    CASSIUS
      185  As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
      186  And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
      187  What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
  Direction: Re-enter CAESAR and his Train
    BRUTUS
      188  I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
      189  The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
      190  And all the rest look like a chidden train:
      191  Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
      192  Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
      193  As we have seen him in the Capitol,
      194  Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
    CASSIUS
      195  Casca will tell us what the matter is.
    CAESAR
      196  Antonius!
    ANTONY
      197  Caesar?
    CAESAR
      198  Let me have men about me that are fat;
      199  Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
      200  Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
      201  He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
    ANTONY
      202  Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
      203  He is a noble Roman and well given.
    CAESAR
      204  Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
      205  Yet if my name were liable to fear,
      206  I do not know the man I should avoid
      207  So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
      208  He is a great observer and he looks
      209  Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
      210  As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
      211  Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
      212  As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
      213  That could be moved to smile at any thing.
      214  Such men as he be never at heart's ease
      215  Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
      216  And therefore are they very dangerous.
      217  I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
      218  Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
      219  Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
      220  And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
  Direction: Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA
    CASCA
      221  You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
    BRUTUS
      222  Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
      223  That Caesar looks so sad.
    CASCA
      224  Why, you were with him, were you not?
    BRUTUS
      225  I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
    CASCA
      226  Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
      227  offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
      228  thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
    BRUTUS
      229  What was the second noise for?
    CASCA
      230  Why, for that too.
    CASSIUS
      231  They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
    CASCA
      232  Why, for that too.
    BRUTUS
      233  Was the crown offered him thrice?
    CASCA
      234  Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
      235  time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
      236  mine honest neighbours shouted.
    CASSIUS
      237  Who offered him the crown?
    CASCA
      238  Why, Antony.
    BRUTUS
      239  Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
    CASCA
      240  I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
      241  it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
      242  Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
      243  neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
      244  you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
      245  thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
      246  offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
      247  but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
      248  fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
      249  time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
      250  refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
      251  chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
      252  and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
      253  Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
      254  Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
      255  for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
      256  opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
    CASSIUS
      257  But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
    CASCA
      258  He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
      259  mouth, and was speechless.
    BRUTUS
      260  'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
    CASSIUS
      261  No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
      262  And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
    CASCA
      263  I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
      264  Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
      265  clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
      266  displeased them, as they use to do the players in
      267  the theatre, I am no true man.
    BRUTUS
      268  What said he when he came unto himself?
    CASCA
      269  Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
      270  common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
      271  plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
      272  throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
      273  occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
      274  I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
      275  he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
      276  If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
      277  their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
      278  or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
      279  soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
      280  there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
      281  stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
    BRUTUS
      282  And after that, he came, thus sad, away?
    CASCA
      283  Ay.
    CASSIUS
      284  Did Cicero say any thing?
    CASCA
      285  Ay, he spoke Greek.
    CASSIUS
      286  To what effect?
    CASCA
      287  Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
      288  face again: but those that understood him smiled at
      289  one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
      290  part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
      291  news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
      292  off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
      293  well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
      294  remember it.
    CASSIUS
      295  Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
    CASCA
      296  No, I am promised forth.
    CASSIUS
      297  Will you dine with me to-morrow?
    CASCA
      298  Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
      299  worth the eating.
    CASSIUS
      300  Good: I will expect you.
    CASCA
      301  Do so. Farewell, both.
  Direction: Exit
    BRUTUS
      302  What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
      303  He was quick mettle when he went to school.
    CASSIUS
      304  So is he now in execution
      305  Of any bold or noble enterprise,
      306  However he puts on this tardy form.
      307  This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
      308  Which gives men stomach to digest his words
      309  With better appetite.
    BRUTUS
      310  And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
      311  To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
      312  I will come home to you; or, if you will,
      313  Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
    CASSIUS
      314  I will do so: till then, think of the world.
  Direction: Exit BRUTUS
      315  Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
      316  Thy honourable metal may be wrought
      317  From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
      318  That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
      319  For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
      320  Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
      321  If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
      322  He should not humour me. I will this night,
      323  In several hands, in at his windows throw,
      324  As if they came from several citizens,
      325  Writings all tending to the great opinion
      326  That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
      327  Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
      328  And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
      329  For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
  Direction: Exit
