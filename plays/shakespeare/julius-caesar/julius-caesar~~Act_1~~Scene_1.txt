          Julius Caesar : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Rome. A street.
  Direction: Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners
    FLAVIUS
        1  Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
        2  Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
        3  Being mechanical, you ought not walk
        4  Upon a labouring day without the sign
        5  Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
    First Commoner
        6  Why, sir, a carpenter.
    MARULLUS
        7  Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
        8  What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
        9  You, sir, what trade are you?
    Second Commoner
       10  Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
       11  as you would say, a cobbler.
    MARULLUS
       12  But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
    Second Commoner
       13  A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
       14  conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
    MARULLUS
       15  What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?
    Second Commoner
       16  Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
       17  if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
    MARULLUS
       18  What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!
    Second Commoner
       19  Why, sir, cobble you.
    FLAVIUS
       20  Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
    Second Commoner
       21  Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
       22  meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
       23  matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
       24  to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
       25  recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
       26  neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
    FLAVIUS
       27  But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
       28  Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
    Second Commoner
       29  Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
       30  into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
       31  to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
    MARULLUS
       32  Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
       33  What tributaries follow him to Rome,
       34  To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
       35  You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
       36  O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
       37  Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
       38  Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
       39  To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
       40  Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
       41  The livelong day, with patient expectation,
       42  To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
       43  And when you saw his chariot but appear,
       44  Have you not made an universal shout,
       45  That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
       46  To hear the replication of your sounds
       47  Made in her concave shores?
       48  And do you now put on your best attire?
       49  And do you now cull out a holiday?
       50  And do you now strew flowers in his way
       51  That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
       52  Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
       53  Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
       54  That needs must light on this ingratitude.
    FLAVIUS
       55  Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
       56  Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
       57  Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
       58  Into the channel, till the lowest stream
       59  Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
  Direction: Exeunt all the Commoners
       60  See whether their basest metal be not moved;
       61  They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
       62  Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
       63  This way will I disrobe the images,
       64  If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
    MARULLUS
       65  May we do so?
       66  You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
    FLAVIUS
       67  It is no matter; let no images
       68  Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
       69  And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
       70  So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
       71  These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
       72  Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
       73  Who else would soar above the view of men
       74  And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
  Direction: Exeunt
