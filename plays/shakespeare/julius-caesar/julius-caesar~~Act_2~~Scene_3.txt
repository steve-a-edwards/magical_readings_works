          Julius Caesar : Act 2 : Scene 3

SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.
  Direction: Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper
    ARTEMIDORUS
        1  'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;
        2  come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not
        3  Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
        4  loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
        5  There is but one mind in all these men, and it is
        6  bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,
        7  look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
        8  The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
        9  'ARTEMIDORUS.'
       10  Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
       11  And as a suitor will I give him this.
       12  My heart laments that virtue cannot live
       13  Out of the teeth of emulation.
       14  If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;
       15  If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
  Direction: Exit
