          Julius Caesar : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.
  Direction: Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them
    BRUTUS
        1  Stand, ho!
    LUCILIUS
        2  Give the word, ho! and stand.
    BRUTUS
        3  What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
    LUCILIUS
        4  He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
        5  To do you salutation from his master.
    BRUTUS
        6  He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
        7  In his own change, or by ill officers,
        8  Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
        9  Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
       10  I shall be satisfied.
    PINDARUS
       11  I do not doubt
       12  But that my noble master will appear
       13  Such as he is, full of regard and honour.
    BRUTUS
       14  He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
       15  How he received you, let me be resolved.
    LUCILIUS
       16  With courtesy and with respect enough;
       17  But not with such familiar instances,
       18  Nor with such free and friendly conference,
       19  As he hath used of old.
    BRUTUS
       20  Thou hast described
       21  A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
       22  When love begins to sicken and decay,
       23  It useth an enforced ceremony.
       24  There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
       25  But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
       26  Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
       27  But when they should endure the bloody spur,
       28  They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
       29  Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
    LUCILIUS
       30  They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;
       31  The greater part, the horse in general,
       32  Are come with Cassius.
    BRUTUS
       33  Hark! he is arrived.
  Direction: Low march within
       34  March gently on to meet him.
  Direction: Enter CASSIUS and his powers
    CASSIUS
       35  Stand, ho!
    BRUTUS
       36  Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
    First Soldier
       37  Stand!
    Second Soldier
       38  Stand!
    Third Soldier
       39  Stand!
    CASSIUS
       40  Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
    BRUTUS
       41  Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
       42  And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
    CASSIUS
       43  Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
       44  And when you do them--
    BRUTUS
       45  Cassius, be content.
       46  Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
       47  Before the eyes of both our armies here,
       48  Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
       49  Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
       50  Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
       51  And I will give you audience.
    CASSIUS
       52  Pindarus,
       53  Bid our commanders lead their charges off
       54  A little from this ground.
    BRUTUS
       55  Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
       56  Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
       57  Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
  Direction: Exeunt
