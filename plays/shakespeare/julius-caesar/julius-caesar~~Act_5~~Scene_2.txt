          Julius Caesar : Act 5 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.
  Direction: Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA
    BRUTUS
        1  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
        2  Unto the legions on the other side.
  Direction: Loud alarum
        3  Let them set on at once; for I perceive
        4  But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
        5  And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
        6  Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.
  Direction: Exeunt
