          Julius Caesar : Act 4 : Scene 3

SCENE III. Brutus's tent.
  Direction: Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS
    CASSIUS
        1  That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
        2  You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
        3  For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
        4  Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
        5  Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
    BRUTUS
        6  You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
    CASSIUS
        7  In such a time as this it is not meet
        8  That every nice offence should bear his comment.
    BRUTUS
        9  Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
       10  Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
       11  To sell and mart your offices for gold
       12  To undeservers.
    CASSIUS
       13  I an itching palm!
       14  You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
       15  Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
    BRUTUS
       16  The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
       17  And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
    CASSIUS
       18  Chastisement!
    BRUTUS
       19  Remember March, the ides of March remember:
       20  Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
       21  What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
       22  And not for justice? What, shall one of us
       23  That struck the foremost man of all this world
       24  But for supporting robbers, shall we now
       25  Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
       26  And sell the mighty space of our large honours
       27  For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
       28  I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
       29  Than such a Roman.
    CASSIUS
       30  Brutus, bay not me;
       31  I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
       32  To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
       33  Older in practise, abler than yourself
       34  To make conditions.
    BRUTUS
       35  Go to; you are not, Cassius.
    CASSIUS
       36  I am.
    BRUTUS
       37  I say you are not.
    CASSIUS
       38  Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
       39  Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
    BRUTUS
       40  Away, slight man!
    CASSIUS
       41  Is't possible?
    BRUTUS
       42  Hear me, for I will speak.
       43  Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
       44  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
    CASSIUS
       45  O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?
    BRUTUS
       46  All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
       47  Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
       48  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
       49  Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
       50  Under your testy humour? By the gods
       51  You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
       52  Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
       53  I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
       54  When you are waspish.
    CASSIUS
       55  Is it come to this?
    BRUTUS
       56  You say you are a better soldier:
       57  Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
       58  And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
       59  I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
    CASSIUS
       60  You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
       61  I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
       62  Did I say 'better'?
    BRUTUS
       63  If you did, I care not.
    CASSIUS
       64  When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
    BRUTUS
       65  Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
    CASSIUS
       66  I durst not!
    BRUTUS
       67  No.
    CASSIUS
       68  What, durst not tempt him!
    BRUTUS
       69  For your life you durst not!
    CASSIUS
       70  Do not presume too much upon my love;
       71  I may do that I shall be sorry for.
    BRUTUS
       72  You have done that you should be sorry for.
       73  There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
       74  For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
       75  That they pass by me as the idle wind,
       76  Which I respect not. I did send to you
       77  For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
       78  For I can raise no money by vile means:
       79  By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
       80  And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
       81  From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
       82  By any indirection: I did send
       83  To you for gold to pay my legions,
       84  Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
       85  Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
       86  When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
       87  To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
       88  Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
       89  Dash him to pieces!
    CASSIUS
       90  I denied you not.
    BRUTUS
       91  You did.
    CASSIUS
       92  I did not: he was but a fool that brought
       93  My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
       94  A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
       95  But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
    BRUTUS
       96  I do not, till you practise them on me.
    CASSIUS
       97  You love me not.
    BRUTUS
       98  I do not like your faults.
    CASSIUS
       99  A friendly eye could never see such faults.
    BRUTUS
      100  A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
      101  As huge as high Olympus.
    CASSIUS
      102  Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
      103  Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
      104  For Cassius is aweary of the world;
      105  Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
      106  Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
      107  Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
      108  To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
      109  My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
      110  And here my naked breast; within, a heart
      111  Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
      112  If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
      113  I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
      114  Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
      115  When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
      116  Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
    BRUTUS
      117  Sheathe your dagger:
      118  Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
      119  Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
      120  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
      121  That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
      122  Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
      123  And straight is cold again.
    CASSIUS
      124  Hath Cassius lived
      125  To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
      126  When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?
    BRUTUS
      127  When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
    CASSIUS
      128  Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
    BRUTUS
      129  And my heart too.
    CASSIUS
      130  O Brutus!
    BRUTUS
      131  What's the matter?
    CASSIUS
      132  Have not you love enough to bear with me,
      133  When that rash humour which my mother gave me
      134  Makes me forgetful?
    BRUTUS
      135  Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
      136  When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
      137  He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
    Poet
      138  [Within] Let me go in to see the generals;
      139  There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
      140  They be alone.
    LUCILIUS
      141  [Within] You shall not come to them.
    Poet
      142  [Within] Nothing but death shall stay me.
  Direction: Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS
    CASSIUS
      143  How now! what's the matter?
    Poet
      144  For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
      145  Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
      146  For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
    CASSIUS
      147  Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
    BRUTUS
      148  Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
    CASSIUS
      149  Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
    BRUTUS
      150  I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
      151  What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
      152  Companion, hence!
    CASSIUS
      153  Away, away, be gone.
  Direction: Exit Poet
    BRUTUS
      154  Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
      155  Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
    CASSIUS
      156  And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
      157  Immediately to us.
  Direction: Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS
    BRUTUS
      158  Lucius, a bowl of wine!
  Direction: Exit LUCIUS
    CASSIUS
      159  I did not think you could have been so angry.
    BRUTUS
      160  O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
    CASSIUS
      161  Of your philosophy you make no use,
      162  If you give place to accidental evils.
    BRUTUS
      163  No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
    CASSIUS
      164  Ha! Portia!
    BRUTUS
      165  She is dead.
    CASSIUS
      166  How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
      167  O insupportable and touching loss!
      168  Upon what sickness?
    BRUTUS
      169  Impatient of my absence,
      170  And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
      171  Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
      172  That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
      173  And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.
    CASSIUS
      174  And died so?
    BRUTUS
      175  Even so.
    CASSIUS
      176  O ye immortal gods!
  Direction: Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper
    BRUTUS
      177  Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
      178  In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
    CASSIUS
      179  My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
      180  Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
      181  I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
    BRUTUS
      182  Come in, Titinius!
  Direction: Exit LUCIUS
  Direction: Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA
      183  Welcome, good Messala.
      184  Now sit we close about this taper here,
      185  And call in question our necessities.
    CASSIUS
      186  Portia, art thou gone?
    BRUTUS
      187  No more, I pray you.
      188  Messala, I have here received letters,
      189  That young Octavius and Mark Antony
      190  Come down upon us with a mighty power,
      191  Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
    MESSALA
      192  Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
    BRUTUS
      193  With what addition?
    MESSALA
      194  That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
      195  Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
      196  Have put to death an hundred senators.
    BRUTUS
      197  Therein our letters do not well agree;
      198  Mine speak of seventy senators that died
      199  By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
    CASSIUS
      200  Cicero one!
    MESSALA
      201  Cicero is dead,
      202  And by that order of proscription.
      203  Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
    BRUTUS
      204  No, Messala.
    MESSALA
      205  Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
    BRUTUS
      206  Nothing, Messala.
    MESSALA
      207  That, methinks, is strange.
    BRUTUS
      208  Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
    MESSALA
      209  No, my lord.
    BRUTUS
      210  Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
    MESSALA
      211  Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
      212  For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
    BRUTUS
      213  Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
      214  With meditating that she must die once,
      215  I have the patience to endure it now.
    MESSALA
      216  Even so great men great losses should endure.
    CASSIUS
      217  I have as much of this in art as you,
      218  But yet my nature could not bear it so.
    BRUTUS
      219  Well, to our work alive. What do you think
      220  Of marching to Philippi presently?
    CASSIUS
      221  I do not think it good.
    BRUTUS
      222  Your reason?
    CASSIUS
      223  This it is:
      224  'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
      225  So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
      226  Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
      227  Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
    BRUTUS
      228  Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
      229  The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
      230  Do stand but in a forced affection;
      231  For they have grudged us contribution:
      232  The enemy, marching along by them,
      233  By them shall make a fuller number up,
      234  Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
      235  From which advantage shall we cut him off,
      236  If at Philippi we do face him there,
      237  These people at our back.
    CASSIUS
      238  Hear me, good brother.
    BRUTUS
      239  Under your pardon. You must note beside,
      240  That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
      241  Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
      242  The enemy increaseth every day;
      243  We, at the height, are ready to decline.
      244  There is a tide in the affairs of men,
      245  Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
      246  Omitted, all the voyage of their life
      247  Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
      248  On such a full sea are we now afloat;
      249  And we must take the current when it serves,
      250  Or lose our ventures.
    CASSIUS
      251  Then, with your will, go on;
      252  We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
    BRUTUS
      253  The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
      254  And nature must obey necessity;
      255  Which we will niggard with a little rest.
      256  There is no more to say?
    CASSIUS
      257  No more. Good night:
      258  Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
    BRUTUS
      259  Lucius!
  Direction: Enter LUCIUS
      260  My gown.
  Direction: Exit LUCIUS
      261  Farewell, good Messala:
      262  Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
      263  Good night, and good repose.
    CASSIUS
      264  O my dear brother!
      265  This was an ill beginning of the night:
      266  Never come such division 'tween our souls!
      267  Let it not, Brutus.
    BRUTUS
      268  Every thing is well.
    CASSIUS
      269  Good night, my lord.
    BRUTUS
      270  Good night, good brother.
    TITINIUS and MESSALA
      271  Good night, Lord Brutus.
    BRUTUS
      272  Farewell, every one.
  Direction: Exeunt all but BRUTUS
  Direction: Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown
      273  Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
    LUCIUS
      274  Here in the tent.
    BRUTUS
      275  What, thou speak'st drowsily?
      276  Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.
      277  Call Claudius and some other of my men:
      278  I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
    LUCIUS
      279  Varro and Claudius!
  Direction: Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS
    VARRO
      280  Calls my lord?
    BRUTUS
      281  I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
      282  It may be I shall raise you by and by
      283  On business to my brother Cassius.
    VARRO
      284  So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
    BRUTUS
      285  I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
      286  It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
      287  Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
      288  I put it in the pocket of my gown.
  Direction: VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down
    LUCIUS
      289  I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
    BRUTUS
      290  Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
      291  Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
      292  And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
    LUCIUS
      293  Ay, my lord, an't please you.
    BRUTUS
      294  It does, my boy:
      295  I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
    LUCIUS
      296  It is my duty, sir.
    BRUTUS
      297  I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
      298  I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
    LUCIUS
      299  I have slept, my lord, already.
    BRUTUS
      300  It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
      301  I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
      302  I will be good to thee.
  Direction: Music, and a song
      303  This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
      304  Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
      305  That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
      306  I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
      307  If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
      308  I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
      309  Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
      310  Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
  Direction: Enter the Ghost of CAESAR
      311  How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
      312  I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
      313  That shapes this monstrous apparition.
      314  It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
      315  Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
      316  That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
      317  Speak to me what thou art.
    GHOST
      318  Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
    BRUTUS
      319  Why comest thou?
    GHOST
      320  To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
    BRUTUS
      321  Well; then I shall see thee again?
    GHOST
      322  Ay, at Philippi.
    BRUTUS
      323  Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
  Direction: Exit Ghost
      324  Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
      325  Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
      326  Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!
    LUCIUS
      327  The strings, my lord, are false.
    BRUTUS
      328  He thinks he still is at his instrument.
      329  Lucius, awake!
    LUCIUS
      330  My lord?
    BRUTUS
      331  Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
    LUCIUS
      332  My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
    BRUTUS
      333  Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
    LUCIUS
      334  Nothing, my lord.
    BRUTUS
      335  Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!
  Direction: To VARRO
      336  Fellow thou, awake!
    VARRO
      337  My lord?
    CLAUDIUS
      338  My lord?
    BRUTUS
      339  Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
    VARRO and CLAUDIUS
      340  Did we, my lord?
    BRUTUS
      341  Ay: saw you any thing?
    VARRO
      342  No, my lord, I saw nothing.
    CLAUDIUS
      343  Nor I, my lord.
    BRUTUS
      344  Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
      345  Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
      346  And we will follow.
    VARRO and CLAUDIUS
      347  It shall be done, my lord.
  Direction: Exeunt
