          Julius Caesar : Act 1 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The same. A street.
  Direction: Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO
    CICERO
        1  Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
        2  Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
    CASCA
        3  Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
        4  Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
        5  I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
        6  Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
        7  The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
        8  To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
        9  But never till to-night, never till now,
       10  Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
       11  Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
       12  Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
       13  Incenses them to send destruction.
    CICERO
       14  Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?
    CASCA
       15  A common slave--you know him well by sight--
       16  Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
       17  Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
       18  Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
       19  Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
       20  Against the Capitol I met a lion,
       21  Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
       22  Without annoying me: and there were drawn
       23  Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
       24  Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
       25  Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
       26  And yesterday the bird of night did sit
       27  Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
       28  Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
       29  Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
       30  'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
       31  For, I believe, they are portentous things
       32  Unto the climate that they point upon.
    CICERO
       33  Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
       34  But men may construe things after their fashion,
       35  Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
       36  Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
    CASCA
       37  He doth; for he did bid Antonius
       38  Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
    CICERO
       39  Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
       40  Is not to walk in.
    CASCA
       41  Farewell, Cicero.
  Direction: Exit CICERO
  Direction: Enter CASSIUS
    CASSIUS
       42  Who's there?
    CASCA
       43  A Roman.
    CASSIUS
       44  Casca, by your voice.
    CASCA
       45  Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
    CASSIUS
       46  A very pleasing night to honest men.
    CASCA
       47  Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
    CASSIUS
       48  Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
       49  For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
       50  Submitting me unto the perilous night,
       51  And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
       52  Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
       53  And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
       54  The breast of heaven, I did present myself
       55  Even in the aim and very flash of it.
    CASCA
       56  But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
       57  It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
       58  When the most mighty gods by tokens send
       59  Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
    CASSIUS
       60  You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
       61  That should be in a Roman you do want,
       62  Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
       63  And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
       64  To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
       65  But if you would consider the true cause
       66  Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
       67  Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
       68  Why old men fool and children calculate,
       69  Why all these things change from their ordinance
       70  Their natures and preformed faculties
       71  To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
       72  That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
       73  To make them instruments of fear and warning
       74  Unto some monstrous state.
       75  Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
       76  Most like this dreadful night,
       77  That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
       78  As doth the lion in the Capitol,
       79  A man no mightier than thyself or me
       80  In personal action, yet prodigious grown
       81  And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
    CASCA
       82  'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
    CASSIUS
       83  Let it be who it is: for Romans now
       84  Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
       85  But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
       86  And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
       87  Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
    CASCA
       88  Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
       89  Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
       90  And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
       91  In every place, save here in Italy.
    CASSIUS
       92  I know where I will wear this dagger then;
       93  Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
       94  Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
       95  Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
       96  Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
       97  Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
       98  Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
       99  But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
      100  Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
      101  If I know this, know all the world besides,
      102  That part of tyranny that I do bear
      103  I can shake off at pleasure.
  Direction: Thunder still
    CASCA
      104  So can I:
      105  So every bondman in his own hand bears
      106  The power to cancel his captivity.
    CASSIUS
      107  And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
      108  Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
      109  But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
      110  He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
      111  Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
      112  Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
      113  What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
      114  For the base matter to illuminate
      115  So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
      116  Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
      117  Before a willing bondman; then I know
      118  My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
      119  And dangers are to me indifferent.
    CASCA
      120  You speak to Casca, and to such a man
      121  That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
      122  Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
      123  And I will set this foot of mine as far
      124  As who goes farthest.
    CASSIUS
      125  There's a bargain made.
      126  Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
      127  Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
      128  To undergo with me an enterprise
      129  Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
      130  And I do know, by this, they stay for me
      131  In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
      132  There is no stir or walking in the streets;
      133  And the complexion of the element
      134  In favour's like the work we have in hand,
      135  Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
    CASCA
      136  Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
    CASSIUS
      137  'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
      138  He is a friend.
  Direction: Enter CINNA
      139  Cinna, where haste you so?
    CINNA
      140  To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
    CASSIUS
      141  No, it is Casca; one incorporate
      142  To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
    CINNA
      143  I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
      144  There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
    CASSIUS
      145  Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
    CINNA
      146  Yes, you are.
      147  O Cassius, if you could
      148  But win the noble Brutus to our party--
    CASSIUS
      149  Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
      150  And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
      151  Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
      152  In at his window; set this up with wax
      153  Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
      154  Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
      155  Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
    CINNA
      156  All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
      157  To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
      158  And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
    CASSIUS
      159  That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
  Direction: Exit CINNA
      160  Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
      161  See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
      162  Is ours already, and the man entire
      163  Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
    CASCA
      164  O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
      165  And that which would appear offence in us,
      166  His countenance, like richest alchemy,
      167  Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
    CASSIUS
      168  Him and his worth and our great need of him
      169  You have right well conceited. Let us go,
      170  For it is after midnight; and ere day
      171  We will awake him and be sure of him.
  Direction: Exeunt
