          Macbeth : Act 1 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.
  Direction: Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter
    LADY MACBETH
        1  'They met me in the day of success: and I have
        2  learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
        3  them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
        4  to question them further, they made themselves air,
        5  into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
        6  the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
        7  all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
        8  before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
        9  me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
       10  shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
       11  thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
       12  mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
       13  ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
       14  to thy heart, and farewell.'
       15  Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
       16  What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
       17  It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
       18  To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
       19  Art not without ambition, but without
       20  The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
       21  That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
       22  And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
       23  That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
       24  And that which rather thou dost fear to do
       25  Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
       26  That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
       27  And chastise with the valour of my tongue
       28  All that impedes thee from the golden round,
       29  Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
       30  To have thee crown'd withal.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
       31  What is your tidings?
    Messenger
       32  The king comes here to-night.
    LADY MACBETH
       33  Thou'rt mad to say it:
       34  Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
       35  Would have inform'd for preparation.
    Messenger
       36  So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
       37  One of my fellows had the speed of him,
       38  Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
       39  Than would make up his message.
    LADY MACBETH
       40  Give him tending;
       41  He brings great news.
  Direction: Exit Messenger
       42  The raven himself is hoarse
       43  That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
       44  Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
       45  That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
       46  And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
       47  Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
       48  Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
       49  That no compunctious visitings of nature
       50  Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
       51  The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
       52  And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
       53  Wherever in your sightless substances
       54  You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
       55  And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
       56  That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
       57  Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
       58  To cry 'Hold, hold!'
  Direction: Enter MACBETH
       59  Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
       60  Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
       61  Thy letters have transported me beyond
       62  This ignorant present, and I feel now
       63  The future in the instant.
    MACBETH
       64  My dearest love,
       65  Duncan comes here to-night.
    LADY MACBETH
       66  And when goes hence?
    MACBETH
       67  To-morrow, as he purposes.
    LADY MACBETH
       68  O, never
       69  Shall sun that morrow see!
       70  Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
       71  May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
       72  Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
       73  Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
       74  But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
       75  Must be provided for: and you shall put
       76  This night's great business into my dispatch;
       77  Which shall to all our nights and days to come
       78  Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
    MACBETH
       79  We will speak further.
    LADY MACBETH
       80  Only look up clear;
       81  To alter favour ever is to fear:
       82  Leave all the rest to me.
  Direction: Exeunt
