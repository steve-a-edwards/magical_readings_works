          Macbeth : Act 5 : Scene 3

SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.
  Direction: Enter MACBETH, Doctor, and Attendants
    MACBETH
        1  Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
        2  Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
        3  I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
        4  Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
        5  All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
        6  'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
        7  Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
        8  false thanes,
        9  And mingle with the English epicures:
       10  The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
       11  Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
  Direction: Enter a Servant
       12  The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
       13  Where got'st thou that goose look?
    Servant
       14  There is ten thousand--
    MACBETH
       15  Geese, villain!
    Servant
       16  Soldiers, sir.
    MACBETH
       17  Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
       18  Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
       19  Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
       20  Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?
    Servant
       21  The English force, so please you.
    MACBETH
       22  Take thy face hence.
  Direction: Exit Servant
       23  Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
       24  When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
       25  Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
       26  I have lived long enough: my way of life
       27  Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
       28  And that which should accompany old age,
       29  As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
       30  I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
       31  Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
       32  Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!
  Direction: Enter SEYTON
    SEYTON
       33  What is your gracious pleasure?
    MACBETH
       34  What news more?
    SEYTON
       35  All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
    MACBETH
       36  I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
       37  Give me my armour.
    SEYTON
       38  'Tis not needed yet.
    MACBETH
       39  I'll put it on.
       40  Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
       41  Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
       42  How does your patient, doctor?
    Doctor
       43  Not so sick, my lord,
       44  As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
       45  That keep her from her rest.
    MACBETH
       46  Cure her of that.
       47  Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
       48  Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
       49  Raze out the written troubles of the brain
       50  And with some sweet oblivious antidote
       51  Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
       52  Which weighs upon the heart?
    Doctor
       53  Therein the patient
       54  Must minister to himself.
    MACBETH
       55  Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
       56  Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
       57  Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
       58  Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
       59  The water of my land, find her disease,
       60  And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
       61  I would applaud thee to the very echo,
       62  That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
       63  What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
       64  Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?
    Doctor
       65  Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
       66  Makes us hear something.
    MACBETH
       67  Bring it after me.
       68  I will not be afraid of death and bane,
       69  Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.
    Doctor
       70  [Aside] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
       71  Profit again should hardly draw me here.
  Direction: Exeunt
