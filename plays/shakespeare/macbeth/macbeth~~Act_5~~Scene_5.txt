          Macbeth : Act 5 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.
  Direction: Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and colours
    MACBETH
        1  Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
        2  The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
        3  Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
        4  Till famine and the ague eat them up:
        5  Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
        6  We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
        7  And beat them backward home.
  Direction: A cry of women within
        8  What is that noise?
    SEYTON
        9  It is the cry of women, my good lord.
  Direction: Exit
    MACBETH
       10  I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
       11  The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
       12  To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
       13  Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
       14  As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
       15  Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
       16  Cannot once start me.
  Direction: Re-enter SEYTON
       17  Wherefore was that cry?
    SEYTON
       18  The queen, my lord, is dead.
    MACBETH
       19  She should have died hereafter;
       20  There would have been a time for such a word.
       21  To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
       22  Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
       23  To the last syllable of recorded time,
       24  And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
       25  The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
       26  Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
       27  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
       28  And then is heard no more: it is a tale
       29  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
       30  Signifying nothing.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
       31  Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
    Messenger
       32  Gracious my lord,
       33  I should report that which I say I saw,
       34  But know not how to do it.
    MACBETH
       35  Well, say, sir.
    Messenger
       36  As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
       37  I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
       38  The wood began to move.
    MACBETH
       39  Liar and slave!
    Messenger
       40  Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
       41  Within this three mile may you see it coming;
       42  I say, a moving grove.
    MACBETH
       43  If thou speak'st false,
       44  Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
       45  Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
       46  I care not if thou dost for me as much.
       47  I pull in resolution, and begin
       48  To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
       49  That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
       50  Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
       51  Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
       52  If this which he avouches does appear,
       53  There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
       54  I gin to be aweary of the sun,
       55  And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
       56  Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
       57  At least we'll die with harness on our back.
  Direction: Exeunt
