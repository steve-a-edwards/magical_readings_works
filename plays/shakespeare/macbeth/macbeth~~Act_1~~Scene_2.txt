          Macbeth : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. A camp near Forres.
  Direction: Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant
    DUNCAN
        1  What bloody man is that? He can report,
        2  As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
        3  The newest state.
    MALCOLM
        4  This is the sergeant
        5  Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
        6  'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
        7  Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
        8  As thou didst leave it.
    Sergeant
        9  Doubtful it stood;
       10  As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
       11  And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
       12  Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
       13  The multiplying villanies of nature
       14  Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
       15  Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
       16  And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
       17  Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
       18  For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
       19  Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
       20  Which smoked with bloody execution,
       21  Like valour's minion carved out his passage
       22  Till he faced the slave;
       23  Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
       24  Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
       25  And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
    DUNCAN
       26  O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
    Sergeant
       27  As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
       28  Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
       29  So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
       30  Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
       31  No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
       32  Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
       33  But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
       34  With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
       35  Began a fresh assault.
    DUNCAN
       36  Dismay'd not this
       37  Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
    Sergeant
       38  Yes;
       39  As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
       40  If I say sooth, I must report they were
       41  As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
       42  Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
       43  Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
       44  Or memorise another Golgotha,
       45  I cannot tell.
       46  But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
    DUNCAN
       47  So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
       48  They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
  Direction: Exit Sergeant, attended
       49  Who comes here?
  Direction: Enter ROSS
    MALCOLM
       50  The worthy thane of Ross.
    LENNOX
       51  What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
       52  That seems to speak things strange.
    ROSS
       53  God save the king!
    DUNCAN
       54  Whence camest thou, worthy thane?
    ROSS
       55  From Fife, great king;
       56  Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
       57  And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
       58  With terrible numbers,
       59  Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
       60  The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
       61  Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
       62  Confronted him with self-comparisons,
       63  Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
       64  Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
       65  The victory fell on us.
    DUNCAN
       66  Great happiness!
    ROSS
       67  That now
       68  Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
       69  Nor would we deign him burial of his men
       70  Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
       71  Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
    DUNCAN
       72  No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
       73  Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
       74  And with his former title greet Macbeth.
    ROSS
       75  I'll see it done.
    DUNCAN
       76  What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.
  Direction: Exeunt
