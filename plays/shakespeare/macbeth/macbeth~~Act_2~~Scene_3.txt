          Macbeth : Act 2 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The same.
  Direction: Knocking within. Enter a Porter
    Porter
        1  Here's a knocking indeed! If a
        2  man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
        3  old turning the key.
  Direction: Knocking within
        4  Knock,
        5  knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
        6  Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
        7  himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
        8  time; have napkins enow about you; here
        9  you'll sweat for't.
  Direction: Knocking within
       10  Knock,
       11  knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
       12  name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
       13  swear in both the scales against either scale;
       14  who committed treason enough for God's sake,
       15  yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
       16  in, equivocator.
  Direction: Knocking within
       17  Knock,
       18  knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
       19  English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
       20  a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
       21  roast your goose.
  Direction: Knocking within
       22  Knock,
       23  knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
       24  this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
       25  it no further: I had thought to have let in
       26  some of all professions that go the primrose
       27  way to the everlasting bonfire.
  Direction: Knocking within
       28  Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.
  Direction: Opens the gate
  Direction: Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX
    MACDUFF
       29  Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
       30  That you do lie so late?
    Porter
       31  'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
       32  second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
       33  provoker of three things.
    MACDUFF
       34  What three things does drink especially provoke?
    Porter
       35  Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
       36  urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
       37  it provokes the desire, but it takes
       38  away the performance: therefore, much drink
       39  may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
       40  it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
       41  him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
       42  and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
       43  not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
       44  in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.
    MACDUFF
       45  I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
    Porter
       46  That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
       47  me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
       48  think, being too strong for him, though he took
       49  up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
       50  him.
    MACDUFF
       51  Is thy master stirring?
  Direction: Enter MACBETH
       52  Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.
    LENNOX
       53  Good morrow, noble sir.
    MACBETH
       54  Good morrow, both.
    MACDUFF
       55  Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
    MACBETH
       56  Not yet.
    MACDUFF
       57  He did command me to call timely on him:
       58  I have almost slipp'd the hour.
    MACBETH
       59  I'll bring you to him.
    MACDUFF
       60  I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
       61  But yet 'tis one.
    MACBETH
       62  The labour we delight in physics pain.
       63  This is the door.
    MACDUFF
       64  I'll make so bold to call,
       65  For 'tis my limited service.
  Direction: Exit
    LENNOX
       66  Goes the king hence to-day?
    MACBETH
       67  He does: he did appoint so.
    LENNOX
       68  The night has been unruly: where we lay,
       69  Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
       70  Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
       71  And prophesying with accents terrible
       72  Of dire combustion and confused events
       73  New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
       74  Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
       75  Was feverous and did shake.
    MACBETH
       76  'Twas a rough night.
    LENNOX
       77  My young remembrance cannot parallel
       78  A fellow to it.
  Direction: Re-enter MACDUFF
    MACDUFF
       79  O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
       80  Cannot conceive nor name thee!
    MACBETH
    LENNOX
       81  What's the matter.
    MACDUFF
       82  Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
       83  Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
       84  The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
       85  The life o' the building!
    MACBETH
       86  What is 't you say? the life?
    LENNOX
       87  Mean you his majesty?
    MACDUFF
       88  Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
       89  With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
       90  See, and then speak yourselves.
  Direction: Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX
       91  Awake, awake!
       92  Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
       93  Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
       94  Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
       95  And look on death itself! up, up, and see
       96  The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
       97  As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
       98  To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
  Direction: Bell rings
  Direction: Enter LADY MACBETH
    LADY MACBETH
       99  What's the business,
      100  That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
      101  The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!
    MACDUFF
      102  O gentle lady,
      103  'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
      104  The repetition, in a woman's ear,
      105  Would murder as it fell.
  Direction: Enter BANQUO
      106  O Banquo, Banquo,
      107  Our royal master 's murder'd!
    LADY MACBETH
      108  Woe, alas!
      109  What, in our house?
    BANQUO
      110  Too cruel any where.
      111  Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
      112  And say it is not so.
  Direction: Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS
    MACBETH
      113  Had I but died an hour before this chance,
      114  I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
      115  There 's nothing serious in mortality:
      116  All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
      117  The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
      118  Is left this vault to brag of.
  Direction: Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN
    DONALBAIN
      119  What is amiss?
    MACBETH
      120  You are, and do not know't:
      121  The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
      122  Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.
    MACDUFF
      123  Your royal father 's murder'd.
    MALCOLM
      124  O, by whom?
    LENNOX
      125  Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
      126  Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
      127  So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
      128  Upon their pillows:
      129  They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
      130  Was to be trusted with them.
    MACBETH
      131  O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
      132  That I did kill them.
    MACDUFF
      133  Wherefore did you so?
    MACBETH
      134  Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
      135  Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
      136  The expedition my violent love
      137  Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
      138  His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
      139  And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
      140  For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
      141  Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
      142  Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
      143  That had a heart to love, and in that heart
      144  Courage to make 's love kno wn?
    LADY MACBETH
      145  Help me hence, ho!
    MACDUFF
      146  Look to the lady.
    MALCOLM
      147  [Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,
      148  That most may claim this argument for ours?
    DONALBAIN
      149  [Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here,
      150  where our fate,
      151  Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
      152  Let 's away;
      153  Our tears are not yet brew'd.
    MALCOLM
      154  [Aside to DONALBAIN] Nor our strong sorrow
      155  Upon the foot of motion.
    BANQUO
      156  Look to the lady:
  Direction: LADY MACBETH is carried out
      157  And when we have our naked frailties hid,
      158  That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
      159  And question this most bloody piece of work,
      160  To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
      161  In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
      162  Against the undivulged pretence I fight
      163  Of treasonous malice.
    MACDUFF
      164  And so do I.
    ALL
      165  So all.
    MACBETH
      166  Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
      167  And meet i' the hall together.
    ALL
      168  Well contented.
  Direction: Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.
    MALCOLM
      169  What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
      170  To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
      171  Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
    DONALBAIN
      172  To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
      173  Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
      174  There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
      175  The nearer bloody.
    MALCOLM
      176  This murderous shaft that's shot
      177  Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
      178  Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
      179  And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
      180  But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
      181  Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.
  Direction: Exeunt
