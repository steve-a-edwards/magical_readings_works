          Macbeth : Act 3 : Scene 6

SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.
  Direction: Enter LENNOX and another Lord
    LENNOX
        1  My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
        2  Which can interpret further: only, I say,
        3  Things have been strangely borne. The
        4  gracious Duncan
        5  Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
        6  And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
        7  Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
        8  For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
        9  Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
       10  It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
       11  To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
       12  How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
       13  In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
       14  That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
       15  Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
       16  For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
       17  To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
       18  He has borne all things well: and I do think
       19  That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
       20  As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
       21  should find
       22  What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
       23  But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
       24  His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
       25  Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
       26  Where he bestows himself?
    Lord
       27  The son of Duncan,
       28  From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
       29  Lives in the English court, and is received
       30  Of the most pious Edward with such grace
       31  That the malevolence of fortune nothing
       32  Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
       33  Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
       34  To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
       35  That, by the help of these--with Him above
       36  To ratify the work--we may again
       37  Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
       38  Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
       39  Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
       40  All which we pine for now: and this report
       41  Hath so exasperate the king that he
       42  Prepares for some attempt of war.
    LENNOX
       43  Sent he to Macduff?
    Lord
       44  He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
       45  The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
       46  And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
       47  That clogs me with this answer.'
    LENNOX
       48  And that well might
       49  Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
       50  His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
       51  Fly to the court of England and unfold
       52  His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
       53  May soon return to this our suffering country
       54  Under a hand accursed!
    Lord
       55  I'll send my prayers with him.
  Direction: Exeunt
