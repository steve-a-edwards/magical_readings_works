          Macbeth : Act 1 : Scene 3

SCENE III. A heath near Forres.
  Direction: Thunder. Enter the three Witches
    First Witch
        1  Where hast thou been, sister?
    Second Witch
        2  Killing swine.
    Third Witch
        3  Sister, where thou?
    First Witch
        4  A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
        5  And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
        6  'Give me,' quoth I:
        7  'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
        8  Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
        9  But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
       10  And, like a rat without a tail,
       11  I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
    Second Witch
       12  I'll give thee a wind.
    First Witch
       13  Thou'rt kind.
    Third Witch
       14  And I another.
    First Witch
       15  I myself have all the other,
       16  And the very ports they blow,
       17  All the quarters that they know
       18  I' the shipman's card.
       19  I will drain him dry as hay:
       20  Sleep shall neither night nor day
       21  Hang upon his pent-house lid;
       22  He shall live a man forbid:
       23  Weary se'nnights nine times nine
       24  Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
       25  Though his bark cannot be lost,
       26  Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
       27  Look what I have.
    Second Witch
       28  Show me, show me.
    First Witch
       29  Here I have a pilot's thumb,
       30  Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
  Direction: Drum within
    Third Witch
       31  A drum, a drum!
       32  Macbeth doth come.
    ALL
       33  The weird sisters, hand in hand,
       34  Posters of the sea and land,
       35  Thus do go about, about:
       36  Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
       37  And thrice again, to make up nine.
       38  Peace! the charm's wound up.
  Direction: Enter MACBETH and BANQUO
    MACBETH
       39  So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
    BANQUO
       40  How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
       41  So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
       42  That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
       43  And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
       44  That man may question? You seem to understand me,
       45  By each at once her chappy finger laying
       46  Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
       47  And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
       48  That you are so.
    MACBETH
       49  Speak, if you can: what are you?
    First Witch
       50  All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
    Second Witch
       51  All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!
    Third Witch
       52  All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
    BANQUO
       53  Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
       54  Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
       55  Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
       56  Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
       57  You greet with present grace and great prediction
       58  Of noble having and of royal hope,
       59  That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
       60  If you can look into the seeds of time,
       61  And say which grain will grow and which will not,
       62  Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
       63  Your favours nor your hate.
    First Witch
       64  Hail!
    Second Witch
       65  Hail!
    Third Witch
       66  Hail!
    First Witch
       67  Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
    Second Witch
       68  Not so happy, yet much happier.
    Third Witch
       69  Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
       70  So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
    First Witch
       71  Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
    MACBETH
       72  Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
       73  By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
       74  But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
       75  A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
       76  Stands not within the prospect of belief,
       77  No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
       78  You owe this strange intelligence? or why
       79  Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
       80  With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
  Direction: Witches vanish
    BANQUO
       81  The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
       82  And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
    MACBETH
       83  Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
       84  As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
    BANQUO
       85  Were such things here as we do speak about?
       86  Or have we eaten on the insane root
       87  That takes the reason prisoner?
    MACBETH
       88  Your children shall be kings.
    BANQUO
       89  You shall be king.
    MACBETH
       90  And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
    BANQUO
       91  To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
  Direction: Enter ROSS and ANGUS
    ROSS
       92  The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
       93  The news of thy success; and when he reads
       94  Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
       95  His wonders and his praises do contend
       96  Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
       97  In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
       98  He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
       99  Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
      100  Strange images of death. As thick as hail
      101  Came post with post; and every one did bear
      102  Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
      103  And pour'd them down before him.
    ANGUS
      104  We are sent
      105  To give thee from our royal master thanks;
      106  Only to herald thee into his sight,
      107  Not pay thee.
    ROSS
      108  And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
      109  He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
      110  In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
      111  For it is thine.
    BANQUO
      112  What, can the devil speak true?
    MACBETH
      113  The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
      114  In borrow'd robes?
    ANGUS
      115  Who was the thane lives yet;
      116  But under heavy judgment bears that life
      117  Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
      118  With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
      119  With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
      120  He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
      121  But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
      122  Have overthrown him.
    MACBETH
      123  [Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
      124  The greatest is behind.
  Direction: To ROSS and ANGUS
      125  Thanks for your pains.
  Direction: To BANQUO
      126  Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
      127  When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
      128  Promised no less to them?
    BANQUO
      129  That trusted home
      130  Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
      131  Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
      132  And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
      133  The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
      134  Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
      135  In deepest consequence.
      136  Cousins, a word, I pray you.
    MACBETH
      137  [Aside] Two truths are told,
      138  As happy prologues to the swelling act
      139  Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
  Direction: Aside
      140  Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
      141  Why hath it given me earnest of success,
      142  Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
      143  If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
      144  Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
      145  And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
      146  Against the use of nature? Present fears
      147  Are less than horrible imaginings:
      148  My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
      149  Shakes so my single state of man that function
      150  Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
      151  But what is not.
    BANQUO
      152  Look, how our partner's rapt.
    MACBETH
      153  [Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
      154  Without my stir.
    BANQUO
      155  New horrors come upon him,
      156  Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
      157  But with the aid of use.
    MACBETH
      158  [Aside] Come what come may,
      159  Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
    BANQUO
      160  Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
    MACBETH
      161  Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
      162  With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
      163  Are register'd where every day I turn
      164  The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
      165  Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
      166  The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
      167  Our free hearts each to other.
    BANQUO
      168  Very gladly.
    MACBETH
      169  Till then, enough. Come, friends.
  Direction: Exeunt
