          Macbeth : Act 5 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane.
  Direction: Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and Soldiers
    MENTEITH
        1  The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
        2  His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
        3  Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
        4  Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
        5  Excite the mortified man.
    ANGUS
        6  Near Birnam wood
        7  Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
    CAITHNESS
        8  Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
    LENNOX
        9  For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
       10  Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
       11  And many unrough youths that even now
       12  Protest their first of manhood.
    MENTEITH
       13  What does the tyrant?
    CAITHNESS
       14  Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
       15  Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
       16  Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
       17  He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
       18  Within the belt of rule.
    ANGUS
       19  Now does he feel
       20  His secret murders sticking on his hands;
       21  Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
       22  Those he commands move only in command,
       23  Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
       24  Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
       25  Upon a dwarfish thief.
    MENTEITH
       26  Who then shall blame
       27  His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
       28  When all that is within him does condemn
       29  Itself for being there?
    CAITHNESS
       30  Well, march we on,
       31  To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
       32  Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
       33  And with him pour we in our country's purge
       34  Each drop of us.
    LENNOX
       35  Or so much as it needs,
       36  To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
       37  Make we our march towards Birnam.
  Direction: Exeunt, marching
