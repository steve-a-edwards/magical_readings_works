          Macbeth : Act 5 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.
  Direction: Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG SIWARD, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching
    MALCOLM
        1  Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
        2  That chambers will be safe.
    MENTEITH
        3  We doubt it nothing.
    SIWARD
        4  What wood is this before us?
    MENTEITH
        5  The wood of Birnam.
    MALCOLM
        6  Let every soldier hew him down a bough
        7  And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
        8  The numbers of our host and make discovery
        9  Err in report of us.
    Soldiers
       10  It shall be done.
    SIWARD
       11  We learn no other but the confident tyrant
       12  Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
       13  Our setting down before 't.
    MALCOLM
       14  'Tis his main hope:
       15  For where there is advantage to be given,
       16  Both more and less have given him the revolt,
       17  And none serve with him but constrained things
       18  Whose hearts are absent too.
    MACDUFF
       19  Let our just censures
       20  Attend the true event, and put we on
       21  Industrious soldiership.
    SIWARD
       22  The time approaches
       23  That will with due decision make us know
       24  What we shall say we have and what we owe.
       25  Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
       26  But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
       27  Towards which advance the war.
  Direction: Exeunt, marching
