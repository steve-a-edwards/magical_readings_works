          Macbeth : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The same.
  Direction: Enter LADY MACBETH
    LADY MACBETH
        1  That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
        2  What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
        3  Hark! Peace!
        4  It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
        5  Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
        6  The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
        7  Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
        8  their possets,
        9  That death and nature do contend about them,
       10  Whether they live or die.
    MACBETH
       11  [Within] Who's there? what, ho!
    LADY MACBETH
       12  Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
       13  And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
       14  Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
       15  He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
       16  My father as he slept, I had done't.
  Direction: Enter MACBETH
       17  My husband!
    MACBETH
       18  I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
    LADY MACBETH
       19  I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
       20  Did not you speak?
    MACBETH
       21  When?
    LADY MACBETH
       22  Now.
    MACBETH
       23  As I descended?
    LADY MACBETH
       24  Ay.
    MACBETH
       25  Hark!
       26  Who lies i' the second chamber?
    LADY MACBETH
       27  Donalbain.
    MACBETH
       28  This is a sorry sight.
  Direction: Looking on his hands
    LADY MACBETH
       29  A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
    MACBETH
       30  There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
       31  'Murder!'
       32  That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
       33  But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
       34  Again to sleep.
    LADY MACBETH
       35  There are two lodged together.
    MACBETH
       36  One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
       37  As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
       38  Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
       39  When they did say 'God bless us!'
    LADY MACBETH
       40  Consider it not so deeply.
    MACBETH
       41  But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
       42  I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
       43  Stuck in my throat.
    LADY MACBETH
       44  These deeds must not be thought
       45  After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
    MACBETH
       46  Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
       47  Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
       48  Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
       49  The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
       50  Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
       51  Chief nourisher in life's feast,--
    LADY MACBETH
       52  What do you mean?
    MACBETH
       53  Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
       54  'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
       55  Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'
    LADY MACBETH
       56  Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
       57  You do unbend your noble strength, to think
       58  So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
       59  And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
       60  Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
       61  They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
       62  The sleepy grooms with blood.
    MACBETH
       63  I'll go no more:
       64  I am afraid to think what I have done;
       65  Look on't again I dare not.
    LADY MACBETH
       66  Infirm of purpose!
       67  Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
       68  Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
       69  That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
       70  I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
       71  For it must seem their guilt.
  Direction: Exit. Knocking within
    MACBETH
       72  Whence is that knocking?
       73  How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
       74  What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
       75  Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
       76  Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
       77  The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
       78  Making the green one red.
  Direction: Re-enter LADY MACBETH
    LADY MACBETH
       79  My hands are of your colour; but I shame
       80  To wear a heart so white.
  Direction: Knocking within
       81  I hear a knocking
       82  At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
       83  A little water clears us of this deed:
       84  How easy is it, then! Your constancy
       85  Hath left you unattended.
  Direction: Knocking within
       86  Hark! more knocking.
       87  Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
       88  And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
       89  So poorly in your thoughts.
    MACBETH
       90  To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
  Direction: Knocking within
       91  Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
  Direction: Exeunt
