    First Witch
        4  Round about the cauldron go;
        5  In the poison'd entrails throw.
        6  Toad, that under cold stone
        7  Days and nights has thirty-one
        8  Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
        9  Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.

       11  Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
    Second Witch
       12  Fillet of a fenny snake,
       13  In the cauldron boil and bake;
       14  Eye of newt and toe of frog,
       15  Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
       16  Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
       17  Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
       18  For a charm of powerful trouble,
       19  Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

       21  Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

       30  Finger of birth-strangled babe
       31  Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,

       34  For the ingredients of our cauldron.

       35  Double, double toil and trouble;
       36  Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
    Second Witch
       37  Cool it with a baboon's blood,
       38  Then the charm is firm and good.
  Direction: Enter HECATE to the other three Witches
    HECATE
       39  O well done! I commend your pains;
       40  And every one shall share i' the gains;
       41  And now about the cauldron sing,
       42  Live elves and fairies in a ring,
       43  Enchanting all that you put in.
  Direction: Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' and c
  Direction: HECATE retires
    Second Witch
       44  By the pricking of my thumbs,
       45  Something wicked this way comes.
       46  Open, locks,
       47  Whoever knocks!
  Direction: Enter MACBETH
    MACBETH
       48  How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
       49  What is't you do?
    ALL
       50  A deed without a name.
    MACBETH
       51  I conjure you, by that which you profess,
       52  Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
       53  Though you untie the winds and let them fight
       54  Against the churches; though the yesty waves
       55  Confound and swallow navigation up;
       56  Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
       57  Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
       58  Though palaces and pyramids do slope
       59  Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
       60  Of nature's germens tumble all together,
       61  Even till destruction sicken; answer me
       62  To what I ask you.
    First Witch
       63  Speak.
    Second Witch
       64  Demand.
    Third Witch
       65  We'll answer.
    First Witch
       66  Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
       67  Or from our masters?
    MACBETH
       68  Call 'em; let me see 'em.
    First Witch
       69  Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
       70  Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
       71  From the murderer's gibbet throw
       72  Into the flame.
    ALL
       73  Come, high or low;
       74  Thyself and office deftly show!
  Direction: Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head
    MACBETH
       75  Tell me, thou unknown power,--
    First Witch
       76  He knows thy thought:
       77  Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
    First Apparition
       78  Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
       79  Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
  Direction: Descends
    MACBETH
       80  Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
       81  Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
       82  word more,--
    First Witch
       83  He will not be commanded: here's another,
       84  More potent than the first.
  Direction: Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child
    Second Apparition
       85  Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
    MACBETH
       86  Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.
    Second Apparition
       87  Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
       88  The power of man, for none of woman born
       89  Shall harm Macbeth.
  Direction: Descends
    MACBETH
       90  Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
       91  But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
       92  And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
       93  That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
       94  And sleep in spite of thunder.
  Direction: Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand
       95  What is this
       96  That rises like the issue of a king,
       97  And wears upon his baby-brow the round
       98  And top of sovereignty?
    ALL
       99  Listen, but speak not to't.
    Third Apparition
      100  Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
      101  Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
      102  Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
      103  Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
      104  Shall come against him.
  Direction: Descends
    MACBETH
      105  That will never be
      106  Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
      107  Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
      108  Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
      109  Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
      110  Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
      111  To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
      112  Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
      113  Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
      114  Reign in this kingdom?
    ALL
      115  Seek to know no more.
    MACBETH
      116  I will be satisfied: deny me this,
      117  And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
      118  Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
  Direction: Hautboys
    First Witch
      119  Show!
    Second Witch
      120  Show!
    Third Witch
      121  Show!
    ALL
      122  Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
      123  Come like shadows, so depart!
  Direction: A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following
    MACBETH
      124  Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
      125  Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
      126  Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
      127  A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
      128  Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
      129  What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
      130  Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
      131  And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
      132  Which shows me many more; and some I see
      133  That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
      134  Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
      135  For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
      136  And points at them for his.
  Direction: Apparitions vanish
      137  What, is this so?
    First Witch
      138  Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
      139  Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
      140  Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
      141  And show the best of our delights:
      142  I'll charm the air to give a sound,
      143  While you perform your antic round:
      144  That this great king may kindly say,
      145  Our duties did his welcome pay.
  Direction: Music. The witches dance and then vanish, with HECATE
    MACBETH
      146  Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
      147  Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
      148  Come in, without there!
  Direction: Enter LENNOX
    LENNOX
      149  What's your grace's will?
    MACBETH
      150  Saw you the weird sisters?
    LENNOX
      151  No, my lord.
    MACBETH
      152  Came they not by you?
    LENNOX
      153  No, indeed, my lord.
    MACBETH
      154  Infected be the air whereon they ride;
      155  And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
      156  The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
    LENNOX
      157  'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
      158  Macduff is fled to England.
    MACBETH
      159  Fled to England!
    LENNOX
      160  Ay, my good lord.
    MACBETH
      161  Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
      162  The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
      163  Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
      164  The very firstlings of my heart shall be
      165  The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
      166  To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
      167  The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
      168  Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
      169  His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
      170  That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
      171  This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
      172  But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
      173  Come, bring me where they are.
  Direction: Exeunt
