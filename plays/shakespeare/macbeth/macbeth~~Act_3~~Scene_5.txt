          Macbeth : Act 3 : Scene 5

SCENE V. A Heath.
  Direction: Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE
    First Witch
        1  Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.
    HECATE
        2  Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
        3  Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
        4  To trade and traffic with Macbeth
        5  In riddles and affairs of death;
        6  And I, the mistress of your charms,
        7  The close contriver of all harms,
        8  Was never call'd to bear my part,
        9  Or show the glory of our art?
       10  And, which is worse, all you have done
       11  Hath been but for a wayward son,
       12  Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
       13  Loves for his own ends, not for you.
       14  But make amends now: get you gone,
       15  And at the pit of Acheron
       16  Meet me i' the morning: thither he
       17  Will come to know his destiny:
       18  Your vessels and your spells provide,
       19  Your charms and every thing beside.
       20  I am for the air; this night I'll spend
       21  Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
       22  Great business must be wrought ere noon:
       23  Upon the corner of the moon
       24  There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
       25  I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
       26  And that distill'd by magic sleights
       27  Shall raise such artificial sprites
       28  As by the strength of their illusion
       29  Shall draw him on to his confusion:
       30  He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
       31  He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:
       32  And you all know, security
       33  Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
  Direction: Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,' and c
       34  Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,
       35  Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.
  Direction: Exit
    First Witch
       36  Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.
  Direction: Exeunt
