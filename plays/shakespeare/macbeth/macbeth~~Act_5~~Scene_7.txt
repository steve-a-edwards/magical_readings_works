          Macbeth : Act 5 : Scene 7

SCENE VII. Another part of the field.
  Direction: Alarums. Enter MACBETH
    MACBETH
        1  They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
        2  But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
        3  That was not born of woman? Such a one
        4  Am I to fear, or none.
  Direction: Enter YOUNG SIWARD
    YOUNG SIWARD
        5  What is thy name?
    MACBETH
        6  Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
    YOUNG SIWARD
        7  No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
        8  Than any is in hell.
    MACBETH
        9  My name's Macbeth.
    YOUNG SIWARD
       10  The devil himself could not pronounce a title
       11  More hateful to mine ear.
    MACBETH
       12  No, nor more fearful.
    YOUNG SIWARD
       13  Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
       14  I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
  Direction: They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain
    MACBETH
       15  Thou wast born of woman
       16  But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
       17  Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Alarums. Enter MACDUFF
    MACDUFF
       18  That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
       19  If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
       20  My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
       21  I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
       22  Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
       23  Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
       24  I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
       25  By this great clatter, one of greatest note
       26  Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
       27  And more I beg not.
  Direction: Exit. Alarums
  Direction: Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD
    SIWARD
       28  This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:
       29  The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
       30  The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
       31  The day almost itself professes yours,
       32  And little is to do.
    MALCOLM
       33  We have met with foes
       34  That strike beside us.
    SIWARD
       35  Enter, sir, the castle.
  Direction: Exeunt. Alarums
