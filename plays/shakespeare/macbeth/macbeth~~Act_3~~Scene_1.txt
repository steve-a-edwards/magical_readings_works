          Macbeth : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Forres. The palace.
  Direction: Enter BANQUO
    BANQUO
        1  Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
        2  As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
        3  Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
        4  It should not stand in thy posterity,
        5  But that myself should be the root and father
        6  Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
        7  As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
        8  Why, by the verities on thee made good,
        9  May they not be my oracles as well,
       10  And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.
  Direction: Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants
    MACBETH
       11  Here's our chief guest.
    LADY MACBETH
       12  If he had been forgotten,
       13  It had been as a gap in our great feast,
       14  And all-thing unbecoming.
    MACBETH
       15  To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
       16  And I'll request your presence.
    BANQUO
       17  Let your highness
       18  Command upon me; to the which my duties
       19  Are with a most indissoluble tie
       20  For ever knit.
    MACBETH
       21  Ride you this afternoon?
    BANQUO
       22  Ay, my good lord.
    MACBETH
       23  We should have else desired your good advice,
       24  Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
       25  In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
       26  Is't far you ride?
    BANQUO
       27  As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
       28  'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
       29  I must become a borrower of the night
       30  For a dark hour or twain.
    MACBETH
       31  Fail not our feast.
    BANQUO
       32  My lord, I will not.
    MACBETH
       33  We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
       34  In England and in Ireland, not confessing
       35  Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
       36  With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,
       37  When therewithal we shall have cause of state
       38  Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
       39  Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?
    BANQUO
       40  Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.
    MACBETH
       41  I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
       42  And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.
  Direction: Exit BANQUO
       43  Let every man be master of his time
       44  Till seven at night: to make society
       45  The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
       46  Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!
  Direction: Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant
       47  Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
       48  Our pleasure?
    ATTENDANT
       49  They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
    MACBETH
       50  Bring them before us.
  Direction: Exit Attendant
       51  To be thus is nothing;
       52  But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
       53  Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
       54  Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
       55  And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
       56  He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
       57  To act in safety. There is none but he
       58  Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
       59  My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
       60  Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
       61  When first they put the name of king upon me,
       62  And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
       63  They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
       64  Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
       65  And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
       66  Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
       67  No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
       68  For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
       69  For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
       70  Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
       71  Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
       72  Given to the common enemy of man,
       73  To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
       74  Rather than so, come fate into the list.
       75  And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!
  Direction: Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers
       76  Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
  Direction: Exit Attendant
       77  Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
    First Murderer
       78  It was, so please your highness.
    MACBETH
       79  Well then, now
       80  Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
       81  That it was he in the times past which held you
       82  So under fortune, which you thought had been
       83  Our innocent self: this I made good to you
       84  In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
       85  How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
       86  the instruments,
       87  Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
       88  To half a soul and to a notion crazed
       89  Say 'Thus did Banquo.'
    First Murderer
       90  You made it known to us.
    MACBETH
       91  I did so, and went further, which is now
       92  Our point of second meeting. Do you find
       93  Your patience so predominant in your nature
       94  That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
       95  To pray for this good man and for his issue,
       96  Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
       97  And beggar'd yours for ever?
    First Murderer
       98  We are men, my liege.
    MACBETH
       99  Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
      100  As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
      101  Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
      102  All by the name of dogs: the valued file
      103  Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
      104  The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
      105  According to the gift which bounteous nature
      106  Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
      107  Particular addition. from the bill
      108  That writes them all alike: and so of men.
      109  Now, if you have a station in the file,
      110  Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
      111  And I will put that business in your bosoms,
      112  Whose execution takes your enemy off,
      113  Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
      114  Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
      115  Which in his death were perfect.
    Second Murderer
      116  I am one, my liege,
      117  Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
      118  Have so incensed that I am reckless what
      119  I do to spite the world.
    First Murderer
      120  And I another
      121  So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
      122  That I would set my lie on any chance,
      123  To mend it, or be rid on't.
    MACBETH
      124  Both of you
      125  Know Banquo was your enemy.
    Both Murderers
      126  True, my lord.
    MACBETH
      127  So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
      128  That every minute of his being thrusts
      129  Against my near'st of life: and though I could
      130  With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
      131  And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
      132  For certain friends that are both his and mine,
      133  Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
      134  Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
      135  That I to your assistance do make love,
      136  Masking the business from the common eye
      137  For sundry weighty reasons.
    Second Murderer
      138  We shall, my lord,
      139  Perform what you command us.
    First Murderer
      140  Though our lives--
    MACBETH
      141  Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
      142  I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
      143  Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
      144  The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
      145  And something from the palace; always thought
      146  That I require a clearness: and with him--
      147  To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
      148  Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
      149  Whose absence is no less material to me
      150  Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
      151  Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
      152  I'll come to you anon.
    Both Murderers
      153  We are resolved, my lord.
    MACBETH
      154  I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
  Direction: Exeunt Murderers
      155  It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
      156  If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.
  Direction: Exit
