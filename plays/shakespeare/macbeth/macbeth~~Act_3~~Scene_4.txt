          Macbeth : Act 3 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. The same. Hall in the palace.
  Direction: A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants
    MACBETH
        1  You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
        2  And last the hearty welcome.
    Lords
        3  Thanks to your majesty.
    MACBETH
        4  Ourself will mingle with society,
        5  And play the humble host.
        6  Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
        7  We will require her welcome.
    LADY MACBETH
        8  Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
        9  For my heart speaks they are welcome.
  Direction: First Murderer appears at the door
    MACBETH
       10  See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
       11  Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
       12  Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
       13  The table round.
  Direction: Approaching the door
       14  There's blood on thy face.
    First Murderer
       15  'Tis Banquo's then.
    MACBETH
       16  'Tis better thee without than he within.
       17  Is he dispatch'd?
    First Murderer
       18  My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.
    MACBETH
       19  Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
       20  That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
       21  Thou art the nonpareil.
    First Murderer
       22  Most royal sir,
       23  Fleance is 'scaped.
    MACBETH
       24  Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
       25  Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
       26  As broad and general as the casing air:
       27  But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
       28  To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?
    First Murderer
       29  Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
       30  With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
       31  The least a death to nature.
    MACBETH
       32  Thanks for that:
       33  There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
       34  Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
       35  No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
       36  We'll hear, ourselves, again.
  Direction: Exit Murderer
    LADY MACBETH
       37  My royal lord,
       38  You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
       39  That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
       40  'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
       41  From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
       42  Meeting were bare without it.
    MACBETH
       43  Sweet remembrancer!
       44  Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
       45  And health on both!
    LENNOX
       46  May't please your highness sit.
  Direction: The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's place
    MACBETH
       47  Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
       48  Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
       49  Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
       50  Than pity for mischance!
    ROSS
       51  His absence, sir,
       52  Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
       53  To grace us with your royal company.
    MACBETH
       54  The table's full.
    LENNOX
       55  Here is a place reserved, sir.
    MACBETH
       56  Where?
    LENNOX
       57  Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?
    MACBETH
       58  Which of you have done this?
    Lords
       59  What, my good lord?
    MACBETH
       60  Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
       61  Thy gory locks at me.
    ROSS
       62  Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.
    LADY MACBETH
       63  Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
       64  And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
       65  The fit is momentary; upon a thought
       66  He will again be well: if much you note him,
       67  You shall offend him and extend his passion:
       68  Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?
    MACBETH
       69  Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
       70  Which might appal the devil.
    LADY MACBETH
       71  O proper stuff!
       72  This is the very painting of your fear:
       73  This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
       74  Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
       75  Impostors to true fear, would well become
       76  A woman's story at a winter's fire,
       77  Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
       78  Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
       79  You look but on a stool.
    MACBETH
       80  Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
       81  how say you?
       82  Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
       83  If charnel-houses and our graves must send
       84  Those that we bury back, our monuments
       85  Shall be the maws of kites.
  Direction: GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
    LADY MACBETH
       86  What, quite unmann'd in folly?
    MACBETH
       87  If I stand here, I saw him.
    LADY MACBETH
       88  Fie, for shame!
    MACBETH
       89  Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
       90  Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;
       91  Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
       92  Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
       93  That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
       94  And there an end; but now they rise again,
       95  With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
       96  And push us from our stools: this is more strange
       97  Than such a murder is.
    LADY MACBETH
       98  My worthy lord,
       99  Your noble friends do lack you.
    MACBETH
      100  I do forget.
      101  Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
      102  I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
      103  To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
      104  Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
      105  I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
      106  And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
      107  Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
      108  And all to all.
    Lords
      109  Our duties, and the pledge.
  Direction: Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO
    MACBETH
      110  Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
      111  Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
      112  Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
      113  Which thou dost glare with!
    LADY MACBETH
      114  Think of this, good peers,
      115  But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
      116  Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
    MACBETH
      117  What man dare, I dare:
      118  Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
      119  The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
      120  Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
      121  Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
      122  And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
      123  If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
      124  The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
      125  Unreal mockery, hence!
  Direction: GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
      126  Why, so: being gone,
      127  I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.
    LADY MACBETH
      128  You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
      129  With most admired disorder.
    MACBETH
      130  Can such things be,
      131  And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
      132  Without our special wonder? You make me strange
      133  Even to the disposition that I owe,
      134  When now I think you can behold such sights,
      135  And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
      136  When mine is blanched with fear.
    ROSS
      137  What sights, my lord?
    LADY MACBETH
      138  I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
      139  Question enrages him. At once, good night:
      140  Stand not upon the order of your going,
      141  But go at once.
    LENNOX
      142  Good night; and better health
      143  Attend his majesty!
    LADY MACBETH
      144  A kind good night to all!
  Direction: Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH
    MACBETH
      145  It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
      146  Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
      147  Augurs and understood relations have
      148  By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
      149  The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?
    LADY MACBETH
      150  Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
    MACBETH
      151  How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
      152  At our great bidding?
    LADY MACBETH
      153  Did you send to him, sir?
    MACBETH
      154  I hear it by the way; but I will send:
      155  There's not a one of them but in his house
      156  I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
      157  And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
      158  More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
      159  By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
      160  All causes shall give way: I am in blood
      161  Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
      162  Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
      163  Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
      164  Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.
    LADY MACBETH
      165  You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
    MACBETH
      166  Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
      167  Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
      168  We are yet but young in deed.
  Direction: Exeunt
