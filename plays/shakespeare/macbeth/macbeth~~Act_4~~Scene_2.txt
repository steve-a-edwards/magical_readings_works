          Macbeth : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.
  Direction: Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS
    LADY MACDUFF
        1  What had he done, to make him fly the land?
    ROSS
        2  You must have patience, madam.
    LADY MACDUFF
        3  He had none:
        4  His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
        5  Our fears do make us traitors.
    ROSS
        6  You know not
        7  Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
    LADY MACDUFF
        8  Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
        9  His mansion and his titles in a place
       10  From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
       11  He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
       12  The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
       13  Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
       14  All is the fear and nothing is the love;
       15  As little is the wisdom, where the flight
       16  So runs against all reason.
    ROSS
       17  My dearest coz,
       18  I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
       19  He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
       20  The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
       21  much further;
       22  But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
       23  And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
       24  From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
       25  But float upon a wild and violent sea
       26  Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
       27  Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
       28  Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
       29  To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
       30  Blessing upon you!
    LADY MACDUFF
       31  Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
    ROSS
       32  I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
       33  It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
       34  I take my leave at once.
  Direction: Exit
    LADY MACDUFF
       35  Sirrah, your father's dead;
       36  And what will you do now? How will you live?
    Son
       37  As birds do, mother.
    LADY MACDUFF
       38  What, with worms and flies?
    Son
       39  With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
    LADY MACDUFF
       40  Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
       41  The pitfall nor the gin.
    Son
       42  Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
       43  My father is not dead, for all your saying.
    LADY MACDUFF
       44  Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?
    Son
       45  Nay, how will you do for a husband?
    LADY MACDUFF
       46  Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
    Son
       47  Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
    LADY MACDUFF
       48  Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
       49  With wit enough for thee.
    Son
       50  Was my father a traitor, mother?
    LADY MACDUFF
       51  Ay, that he was.
    Son
       52  What is a traitor?
    LADY MACDUFF
       53  Why, one that swears and lies.
    Son
       54  And be all traitors that do so?
    LADY MACDUFF
       55  Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.
    Son
       56  And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
    LADY MACDUFF
       57  Every one.
    Son
       58  Who must hang them?
    LADY MACDUFF
       59  Why, the honest men.
    Son
       60  Then the liars and swearers are fools,
       61  for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
       62  the honest men and hang up them.
    LADY MACDUFF
       63  Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
       64  But how wilt thou do for a father?
    Son
       65  If he were dead, you'ld weep for
       66  him: if you would not, it were a good sign
       67  that I should quickly have a new father.
    LADY MACDUFF
       68  Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
    Messenger
       69  Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
       70  Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
       71  I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
       72  If you will take a homely man's advice,
       73  Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
       74  To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
       75  To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
       76  Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
       77  I dare abide no longer.
  Direction: Exit
    LADY MACDUFF
       78  Whither should I fly?
       79  I have done no harm. But I remember now
       80  I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
       81  Is often laudable, to do good sometime
       82  Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
       83  Do I put up that womanly defence,
       84  To say I have done no harm?
  Direction: Enter Murderers
       85  What are these faces?
    First Murderer
       86  Where is your husband?
    LADY MACDUFF
       87  I hope, in no place so unsanctified
       88  Where such as thou mayst find him.
    First Murderer
       89  He's a traitor.
    Son
       90  Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!
    First Murderer
       91  What, you egg!
  Direction: Stabbing him
       92  Young fry of treachery!
    Son
       93  He has kill'd me, mother:
       94  Run away, I pray you!
  Direction: Dies
  Direction: Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following her
