          Macbeth : Act 3 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The palace.
  Direction: Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant
    LADY MACBETH
        1  Is Banquo gone from court?
    Servant
        2  Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.
    LADY MACBETH
        3  Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
        4  For a few words.
    Servant
        5  Madam, I will.
  Direction: Exit
    LADY MACBETH
        6  Nought's had, all's spent,
        7  Where our desire is got without content:
        8  'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
        9  Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
  Direction: Enter MACBETH
       10  How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
       11  Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
       12  Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
       13  With them they think on? Things without all remedy
       14  Should be without regard: what's done is done.
    MACBETH
       15  We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
       16  She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
       17  Remains in danger of her former tooth.
       18  But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
       19  worlds suffer,
       20  Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
       21  In the affliction of these terrible dreams
       22  That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
       23  Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
       24  Than on the torture of the mind to lie
       25  In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
       26  After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
       27  Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
       28  Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
       29  Can touch him further.
    LADY MACBETH
       30  Come on;
       31  Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
       32  Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.
    MACBETH
       33  So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
       34  Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
       35  Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
       36  Unsafe the while, that we
       37  Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
       38  And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
       39  Disguising what they are.
    LADY MACBETH
       40  You must leave this.
    MACBETH
       41  O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
       42  Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.
    LADY MACBETH
       43  But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
    MACBETH
       44  There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
       45  Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
       46  His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
       47  The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
       48  Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
       49  A deed of dreadful note.
    LADY MACBETH
       50  What's to be done?
    MACBETH
       51  Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
       52  Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
       53  Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
       54  And with thy bloody and invisible hand
       55  Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
       56  Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
       57  Makes wing to the rooky wood:
       58  Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
       59  While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
       60  Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
       61  Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
       62  So, prithee, go with me.
  Direction: Exeunt
