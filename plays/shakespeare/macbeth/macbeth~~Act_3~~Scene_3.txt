          Macbeth : Act 3 : Scene 3

SCENE III. A park near the palace.
  Direction: Enter three Murderers
    First Murderer
        1  But who did bid thee join with us?
    Third Murderer
        2  Macbeth.
    Second Murderer
        3  He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
        4  Our offices and what we have to do
        5  To the direction just.
    First Murderer
        6  Then stand with us.
        7  The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
        8  Now spurs the lated traveller apace
        9  To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
       10  The subject of our watch.
    Third Murderer
       11  Hark! I hear horses.
    BANQUO
       12  [Within] Give us a light there, ho!
    Second Murderer
       13  Then 'tis he: the rest
       14  That are within the note of expectation
       15  Already are i' the court.
    First Murderer
       16  His horses go about.
    Third Murderer
       17  Almost a mile: but he does usually,
       18  So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
       19  Make it their walk.
    Second Murderer
       20  A light, a light!
  Direction: Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch
    Third Murderer
       21  'Tis he.
    First Murderer
       22  Stand to't.
    BANQUO
       23  It will be rain to-night.
    First Murderer
       24  Let it come down.
  Direction: They set upon BANQUO
    BANQUO
       25  O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
       26  Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
  Direction: Dies. FLEANCE escapes
    Third Murderer
       27  Who did strike out the light?
    First Murderer
       28  Wast not the way?
    Third Murderer
       29  There's but one down; the son is fled.
    Second Murderer
       30  We have lost
       31  Best half of our affair.
    First Murderer
       32  Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
  Direction: Exeunt
