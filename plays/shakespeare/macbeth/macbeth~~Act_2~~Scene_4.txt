          Macbeth : Act 2 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.
  Direction: Enter ROSS and an old Man
    Old Man
        1  Threescore and ten I can remember well:
        2  Within the volume of which time I have seen
        3  Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
        4  Hath trifled former knowings.
    ROSS
        5  Ah, good father,
        6  Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
        7  Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
        8  And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
        9  Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
       10  That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
       11  When living light should kiss it?
    Old Man
       12  'Tis unnatural,
       13  Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
       14  A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
       15  Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.
    ROSS
       16  And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
       17  Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
       18  Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
       19  Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
       20  War with mankind.
    Old Man
       21  'Tis said they eat each other.
    ROSS
       22  They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
       23  That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
  Direction: Enter MACDUFF
       24  How goes the world, sir, now?
    MACDUFF
       25  Why, see you not?
    ROSS
       26  Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
    MACDUFF
       27  Those that Macbeth hath slain.
    ROSS
       28  Alas, the day!
       29  What good could they pretend?
    MACDUFF
       30  They were suborn'd:
       31  Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
       32  Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
       33  Suspicion of the deed.
    ROSS
       34  'Gainst nature still!
       35  Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
       36  Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
       37  The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
    MACDUFF
       38  He is already named, and gone to Scone
       39  To be invested.
    ROSS
       40  Where is Duncan's body?
    MACDUFF
       41  Carried to Colmekill,
       42  The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
       43  And guardian of their bones.
    ROSS
       44  Will you to Scone?
    MACDUFF
       45  No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
    ROSS
       46  Well, I will thither.
    MACDUFF
       47  Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
       48  Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
    ROSS
       49  Farewell, father.
    Old Man
       50  God's benison go with you; and with those
       51  That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!
  Direction: Exeunt
