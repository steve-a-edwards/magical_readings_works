          Macbeth : Act 1 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Forres. The palace.
  Direction: Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and Attendants
    DUNCAN
        1  Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
        2  Those in commission yet return'd?
    MALCOLM
        3  My liege,
        4  They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
        5  With one that saw him die: who did report
        6  That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
        7  Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
        8  A deep repentance: nothing in his life
        9  Became him like the leaving it; he died
       10  As one that had been studied in his death
       11  To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
       12  As 'twere a careless trifle.
    DUNCAN
       13  There's no art
       14  To find the mind's construction in the face:
       15  He was a gentleman on whom I built
       16  An absolute trust.
  Direction: Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS
       17  O worthiest cousin!
       18  The sin of my ingratitude even now
       19  Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
       20  That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
       21  To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
       22  That the proportion both of thanks and payment
       23  Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
       24  More is thy due than more than all can pay.
    MACBETH
       25  The service and the loyalty I owe,
       26  In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
       27  Is to receive our duties; and our duties
       28  Are to your throne and state children and servants,
       29  Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
       30  Safe toward your love and honour.
    DUNCAN
       31  Welcome hither:
       32  I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
       33  To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
       34  That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
       35  No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
       36  And hold thee to my heart.
    BANQUO
       37  There if I grow,
       38  The harvest is your own.
    DUNCAN
       39  My plenteous joys,
       40  Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
       41  In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
       42  And you whose places are the nearest, know
       43  We will establish our estate upon
       44  Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
       45  The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
       46  Not unaccompanied invest him only,
       47  But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
       48  On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
       49  And bind us further to you.
    MACBETH
       50  The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
       51  I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
       52  The hearing of my wife with your approach;
       53  So humbly take my leave.
    DUNCAN
       54  My worthy Cawdor!
    MACBETH
       55  [Aside] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
       56  On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
       57  For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
       58  Let not light see my black and deep desires:
       59  The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,
       60  Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
  Direction: Exit
    DUNCAN
       61  True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
       62  And in his commendations I am fed;
       63  It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
       64  Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
       65  It is a peerless kinsman.
  Direction: Flourish. Exeunt
