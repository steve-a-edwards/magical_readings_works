          Macbeth : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Court of Macbeth's castle.
  Direction: Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him
    BANQUO
        1  How goes the night, boy?
    FLEANCE
        2  The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
    BANQUO
        3  And she goes down at twelve.
    FLEANCE
        4  I take't, 'tis later, sir.
    BANQUO
        5  Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
        6  Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
        7  A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
        8  And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
        9  Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
       10  Gives way to in repose!
  Direction: Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch
       11  Give me my sword.
       12  Who's there?
    MACBETH
       13  A friend.
    BANQUO
       14  What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
       15  He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
       16  Sent forth great largess to your offices.
       17  This diamond he greets your wife withal,
       18  By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
       19  In measureless content.
    MACBETH
       20  Being unprepared,
       21  Our will became the servant to defect;
       22  Which else should free have wrought.
    BANQUO
       23  All's well.
       24  I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
       25  To you they have show'd some truth.
    MACBETH
       26  I think not of them:
       27  Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
       28  We would spend it in some words upon that business,
       29  If you would grant the time.
    BANQUO
       30  At your kind'st leisure.
    MACBETH
       31  If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
       32  It shall make honour for you.
    BANQUO
       33  So I lose none
       34  In seeking to augment it, but still keep
       35  My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
       36  I shall be counsell'd.
    MACBETH
       37  Good repose the while!
    BANQUO
       38  Thanks, sir: the like to you!
  Direction: Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE
    MACBETH
       39  Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
       40  She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
  Direction: Exit Servant
       41  Is this a dagger which I see before me,
       42  The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
       43  I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
       44  Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
       45  To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
       46  A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
       47  Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
       48  I see thee yet, in form as palpable
       49  As this which now I draw.
       50  Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
       51  And such an instrument I was to use.
       52  Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
       53  Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
       54  And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
       55  Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
       56  It is the bloody business which informs
       57  Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
       58  Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
       59  The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
       60  Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
       61  Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
       62  Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
       63  With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
       64  Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
       65  Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
       66  Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
       67  And take the present horror from the time,
       68  Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
       69  Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
  Direction: A bell rings
       70  I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
       71  Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
       72  That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
  Direction: Exit
