          Macbeth : Act 5 : Scene 8

SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.
  Direction: Enter MACBETH
    MACBETH
        1  Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
        2  On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
        3  Do better upon them.
  Direction: Enter MACDUFF
    MACDUFF
        4  Turn, hell-hound, turn!
    MACBETH
        5  Of all men else I have avoided thee:
        6  But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
        7  With blood of thine already.
    MACDUFF
        8  I have no words:
        9  My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
       10  Than terms can give thee out!
  Direction: They fight
    MACBETH
       11  Thou losest labour:
       12  As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
       13  With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
       14  Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
       15  I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
       16  To one of woman born.
    MACDUFF
       17  Despair thy charm;
       18  And let the angel whom thou still hast served
       19  Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
       20  Untimely ripp'd.
    MACBETH
       21  Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
       22  For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
       23  And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
       24  That palter with us in a double sense;
       25  That keep the word of promise to our ear,
       26  And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
    MACDUFF
       27  Then yield thee, coward,
       28  And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
       29  We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
       30  Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
       31  'Here may you see the tyrant.'
    MACBETH
       32  I will not yield,
       33  To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
       34  And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
       35  Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
       36  And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
       37  Yet I will try the last. Before my body
       38  I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
       39  And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
  Direction: Exeunt, fighting. Alarums
  Direction: Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers
    MALCOLM
       40  I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
    SIWARD
       41  Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,
       42  So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
    MALCOLM
       43  Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
    ROSS
       44  Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
       45  He only lived but till he was a man;
       46  The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
       47  In the unshrinking station where he fought,
       48  But like a man he died.
    SIWARD
       49  Then he is dead?
    ROSS
       50  Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
       51  Must not be measured by his worth, for then
       52  It hath no end.
    SIWARD
       53  Had he his hurts before?
    ROSS
       54  Ay, on the front.
    SIWARD
       55  Why then, God's soldier be he!
       56  Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
       57  I would not wish them to a fairer death:
       58  And so, his knell is knoll'd.
    MALCOLM
       59  He's worth more sorrow,
       60  And that I'll spend for him.
    SIWARD
       61  He's worth no more
       62  They say he parted well, and paid his score:
       63  And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.
  Direction: Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head
    MACDUFF
       64  Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
       65  The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
       66  I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
       67  That speak my salutation in their minds;
       68  Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
       69  Hail, King of Scotland!
    ALL
       70  Hail, King of Scotland!
  Direction: Flourish
    MALCOLM
       71  We shall not spend a large expense of time
       72  Before we reckon with your several loves,
       73  And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
       74  Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
       75  In such an honour named. What's more to do,
       76  Which would be planted newly with the time,
       77  As calling home our exiled friends abroad
       78  That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
       79  Producing forth the cruel ministers
       80  Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
       81  Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
       82  Took off her life; this, and what needful else
       83  That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
       84  We will perform in measure, time and place:
       85  So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
       86  Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
  Direction: Flourish. Exeunt
