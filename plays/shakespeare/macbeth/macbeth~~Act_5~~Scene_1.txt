          Macbeth : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.
  Direction: Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman
    Doctor
        1  I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
        2  no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
    Gentlewoman
        3  Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
        4  her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
        5  her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
        6  write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
        7  return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
    Doctor
        8  A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
        9  the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
       10  watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
       11  walking and other actual performances, what, at any
       12  time, have you heard her say?
    Gentlewoman
       13  That, sir, which I will not report after her.
    Doctor
       14  You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
    Gentlewoman
       15  Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
       16  confirm my speech.
  Direction: Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper
       17  Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
       18  and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.
    Doctor
       19  How came she by that light?
    Gentlewoman
       20  Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
       21  continually; 'tis her command.
    Doctor
       22  You see, her eyes are open.
    Gentlewoman
       23  Ay, but their sense is shut.
    Doctor
       24  What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.
    Gentlewoman
       25  It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
       26  washing her hands: I have known her continue in
       27  this a quarter of an hour.
    LADY MACBETH
       28  Yet here's a spot.
    Doctor
       29  Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
       30  her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
    LADY MACBETH
       31  Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
       32  then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
       33  lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
       34  fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
       35  account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
       36  to have had so much blood in him.
    Doctor
       37  Do you mark that?
    LADY MACBETH
       38  The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
       39  What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
       40  that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
       41  this starting.
    Doctor
       42  Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
    Gentlewoman
       43  She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
       44  that: heaven knows what she has known.
    LADY MACBETH
       45  Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
       46  perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
       47  hand. Oh, oh, oh!
    Doctor
       48  What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
    Gentlewoman
       49  I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
       50  dignity of the whole body.
    Doctor
       51  Well, well, well,--
    Gentlewoman
       52  Pray God it be, sir.
    Doctor
       53  This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
       54  those which have walked in their sleep who have died
       55  holily in their beds.
    LADY MACBETH
       56  Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
       57  pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he
       58  cannot come out on's grave.
    Doctor
       59  Even so?
    LADY MACBETH
       60  To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
       61  come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
       62  done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!
  Direction: Exit
    Doctor
       63  Will she go now to bed?
    Gentlewoman
       64  Directly.
    Doctor
       65  Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
       66  Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
       67  To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
       68  More needs she the divine than the physician.
       69  God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
       70  Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
       71  And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
       72  My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
       73  I think, but dare not speak.
    Gentlewoman
       74  Good night, good doctor.
  Direction: Exeunt
