          Macbeth : Act 1 : Scene 7

SCENE VII. Macbeth's castle.
  Direction: Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETH
    MACBETH
        1  If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
        2  It were done quickly: if the assassination
        3  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
        4  With his surcease success; that but this blow
        5  Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
        6  But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
        7  We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
        8  We still have judgment here; that we but teach
        9  Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
       10  To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
       11  Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
       12  To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
       13  First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
       14  Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
       15  Who should against his murderer shut the door,
       16  Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
       17  Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
       18  So clear in his great office, that his virtues
       19  Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
       20  The deep damnation of his taking-off;
       21  And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
       22  Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
       23  Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
       24  Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
       25  That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
       26  To prick the sides of my intent, but only
       27  Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
       28  And falls on the other.
  Direction: Enter LADY MACBETH
       29  How now! what news?
    LADY MACBETH
       30  He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?
    MACBETH
       31  Hath he ask'd for me?
    LADY MACBETH
       32  Know you not he has?
    MACBETH
       33  We will proceed no further in this business:
       34  He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
       35  Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
       36  Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
       37  Not cast aside so soon.
    LADY MACBETH
       38  Was the hope drunk
       39  Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
       40  And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
       41  At what it did so freely? From this time
       42  Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
       43  To be the same in thine own act and valour
       44  As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
       45  Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
       46  And live a coward in thine own esteem,
       47  Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
       48  Like the poor cat i' the adage?
    MACBETH
       49  Prithee, peace:
       50  I dare do all that may become a man;
       51  Who dares do more is none.
    LADY MACBETH
       52  What beast was't, then,
       53  That made you break this enterprise to me?
       54  When you durst do it, then you were a man;
       55  And, to be more than what you were, you would
       56  Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
       57  Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
       58  They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
       59  Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
       60  How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
       61  I would, while it was smiling in my face,
       62  Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
       63  And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
       64  Have done to this.
    MACBETH
       65  If we should fail?
    LADY MACBETH
       66  We fail!
       67  But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
       68  And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
       69  Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
       70  Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
       71  Will I with wine and wassail so convince
       72  That memory, the warder of the brain,
       73  Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
       74  A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
       75  Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
       76  What cannot you and I perform upon
       77  The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
       78  His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
       79  Of our great quell?
    MACBETH
       80  Bring forth men-children only;
       81  For thy undaunted mettle should compose
       82  Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
       83  When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
       84  Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
       85  That they have done't?
    LADY MACBETH
       86  Who dares receive it other,
       87  As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
       88  Upon his death?
    MACBETH
       89  I am settled, and bend up
       90  Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
       91  Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
       92  False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
  Direction: Exeunt
