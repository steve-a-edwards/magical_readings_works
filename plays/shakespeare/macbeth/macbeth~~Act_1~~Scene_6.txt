          Macbeth : Act 1 : Scene 6

SCENE VI. Before Macbeth's castle.
  Direction: Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and Attendants
    DUNCAN
        1  This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
        2  Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
        3  Unto our gentle senses.
    BANQUO
        4  This guest of summer,
        5  The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
        6  By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
        7  Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
        8  Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
        9  Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
       10  Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
       11  The air is delicate.
  Direction: Enter LADY MACBETH
    DUNCAN
       12  See, see, our honour'd hostess!
       13  The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
       14  Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
       15  How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
       16  And thank us for your trouble.
    LADY MACBETH
       17  All our service
       18  In every point twice done and then done double
       19  Were poor and single business to contend
       20  Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
       21  Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
       22  And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
       23  We rest your hermits.
    DUNCAN
       24  Where's the thane of Cawdor?
       25  We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
       26  To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
       27  And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
       28  To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
       29  We are your guest to-night.
    LADY MACBETH
       30  Your servants ever
       31  Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
       32  To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
       33  Still to return your own.
    DUNCAN
       34  Give me your hand;
       35  Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
       36  And shall continue our graces towards him.
       37  By your leave, hostess.
  Direction: Exeunt
