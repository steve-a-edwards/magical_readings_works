          A Midsummer Night's Dream : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. The same. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA lying asleep.
  Direction: Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, MUSTARDSEED, and other Fairies attending; OBERON behind unseen
    TITANIA
        1  Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
        2  While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
        3  And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
        4  And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
    BOTTOM
        5  Where's Peaseblossom?
    PEASEBLOSSOM
        6  Ready.
    BOTTOM
        7  Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?
    COBWEB
        8  Ready.
    BOTTOM
        9  Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your
       10  weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
       11  humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
       12  mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
       13  yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,
       14  good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;
       15  I would be loath to have you overflown with a
       16  honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?
    MUSTARDSEED
       17  Ready.
    BOTTOM
       18  Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,
       19  leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.
    MUSTARDSEED
       20  What's your Will?
    BOTTOM
       21  Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb
       22  to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for
       23  methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
       24  am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
       25  I must scratch.
    TITANIA
       26  What, wilt thou hear some music,
       27  my sweet love?
    BOTTOM
       28  I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
       29  the tongs and the bones.
    TITANIA
       30  Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
    BOTTOM
       31  Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
       32  dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
       33  of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
    TITANIA
       34  I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
       35  The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
    BOTTOM
       36  I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
       37  But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
       38  have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
    TITANIA
       39  Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
       40  Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.
  Direction: Exeunt fairies
       41  So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
       42  Gently entwist; the female ivy so
       43  Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
       44  O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!
  Direction: They sleep
  Direction: Enter PUCK
    OBERON
       45  [Advancing] Welcome, good Robin.
       46  See'st thou this sweet sight?
       47  Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
       48  For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
       49  Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
       50  I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
       51  For she his hairy temples then had rounded
       52  With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
       53  And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
       54  Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
       55  Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
       56  Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
       57  When I had at my pleasure taunted her
       58  And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
       59  I then did ask of her her changeling child;
       60  Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
       61  To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
       62  And now I have the boy, I will undo
       63  This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
       64  And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
       65  From off the head of this Athenian swain;
       66  That, he awaking when the other do,
       67  May all to Athens back again repair
       68  And think no more of this night's accidents
       69  But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
       70  But first I will release the fairy queen.
       71  Be as thou wast wont to be;
       72  See as thou wast wont to see:
       73  Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
       74  Hath such force and blessed power.
       75  Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
    TITANIA
       76  My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
       77  Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
    OBERON
       78  There lies your love.
    TITANIA
       79  How came these things to pass?
       80  O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
    OBERON
       81  Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
       82  Titania, music call; and strike more dead
       83  Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
    TITANIA
       84  Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
  Direction: Music, still
    PUCK
       85  Now, when thou wakest, with thine
       86  own fool's eyes peep.
    OBERON
       87  Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
       88  And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
       89  Now thou and I are new in amity,
       90  And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
       91  Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
       92  And bless it to all fair prosperity:
       93  There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
       94  Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
    PUCK
       95  Fairy king, attend, and mark:
       96  I do hear the morning lark.
    OBERON
       97  Then, my queen, in silence sad,
       98  Trip we after the night's shade:
       99  We the globe can compass soon,
      100  Swifter than the wandering moon.
    TITANIA
      101  Come, my lord, and in our flight
      102  Tell me how it came this night
      103  That I sleeping here was found
      104  With these mortals on the ground.
  Direction: Exeunt
  Direction: Horns winded within
  Direction: Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train
    THESEUS
      105  Go, one of you, find out the forester;
      106  For now our observation is perform'd;
      107  And since we have the vaward of the day,
      108  My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
      109  Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
      110  Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
  Direction: Exit an Attendant
      111  We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
      112  And mark the musical confusion
      113  Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
    HIPPOLYTA
      114  I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
      115  When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
      116  With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
      117  Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
      118  The skies, the fountains, every region near
      119  Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
      120  So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
    THESEUS
      121  My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
      122  So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
      123  With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
      124  Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
      125  Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
      126  Each under each. A cry more tuneable
      127  Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
      128  In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
      129  Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?
    EGEUS
      130  My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
      131  And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
      132  This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
      133  I wonder of their being here together.
    THESEUS
      134  No doubt they rose up early to observe
      135  The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
      136  Came here in grace our solemnity.
      137  But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
      138  That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
    EGEUS
      139  It is, my lord.
    THESEUS
      140  Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
  Direction: Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up
      141  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
      142  Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
    LYSANDER
      143  Pardon, my lord.
    THESEUS
      144  I pray you all, stand up.
      145  I know you two are rival enemies:
      146  How comes this gentle concord in the world,
      147  That hatred is so far from jealousy,
      148  To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
    LYSANDER
      149  My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
      150  Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
      151  I cannot truly say how I came here;
      152  But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
      153  And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
      154  I came with Hermia hither: our intent
      155  Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
      156  Without the peril of the Athenian law.
    EGEUS
      157  Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
      158  I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
      159  They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
      160  Thereby to have defeated you and me,
      161  You of your wife and me of my consent,
      162  Of my consent that she should be your wife.
    DEMETRIUS
      163  My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
      164  Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
      165  And I in fury hither follow'd them,
      166  Fair Helena in fancy following me.
      167  But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
      168  But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
      169  Melted as the snow, seems to me now
      170  As the remembrance of an idle gaud
      171  Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
      172  And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
      173  The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
      174  Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
      175  Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
      176  But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
      177  But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
      178  Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
      179  And will for evermore be true to it.
    THESEUS
      180  Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
      181  Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
      182  Egeus, I will overbear your will;
      183  For in the temple by and by with us
      184  These couples shall eternally be knit:
      185  And, for the morning now is something worn,
      186  Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
      187  Away with us to Athens; three and three,
      188  We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
      189  Come, Hippolyta.
  Direction: Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train
    DEMETRIUS
      190  These things seem small and undistinguishable,
    HERMIA
      191  Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
      192  When every thing seems double.
    HELENA
      193  So methinks:
      194  And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
      195  Mine own, and not mine own.
    DEMETRIUS
      196  Are you sure
      197  That we are awake? It seems to me
      198  That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
      199  The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
    HERMIA
      200  Yea; and my father.
    HELENA
      201  And Hippolyta.
    LYSANDER
      202  And he did bid us follow to the temple.
    DEMETRIUS
      203  Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him
      204  And by the way let us recount our dreams.
  Direction: Exeunt
    BOTTOM
      205  [Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will
      206  answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!
      207  Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
      208  the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen
      209  hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
      210  vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to
      211  say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go
      212  about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there
      213  is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and
      214  methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if
      215  he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
      216  of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not
      217  seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue
      218  to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
      219  was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
      220  this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,
      221  because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
      222  latter end of a play, before the duke:
      223  peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall
      224  sing it at her death.
  Direction: Exit
