          A Midsummer Night's Dream : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.
  Direction: Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
    BOTTOM
        1  Are we all met?
    QUINCE
        2  Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
        3  for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
        4  stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
        5  will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
    BOTTOM
        6  Peter Quince,--
    QUINCE
        7  What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
    BOTTOM
        8  There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
        9  Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
       10  draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
       11  cannot abide. How answer you that?
    SNOUT
       12  By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
    STARVELING
       13  I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
    BOTTOM
       14  Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
       15  Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
       16  say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
       17  Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
       18  better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
       19  Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
       20  out of fear.
    QUINCE
       21  Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
       22  written in eight and six.
    BOTTOM
       23  No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
    SNOUT
       24  Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
    STARVELING
       25  I fear it, I promise you.
    BOTTOM
       26  Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
       27  bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
       28  most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
       29  wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
       30  look to 't.
    SNOUT
       31  Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
    BOTTOM
       32  Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
       33  be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
       34  must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
       35  defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
       36  You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
       37  entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
       38  for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
       39  were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
       40  man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
       41  his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
    QUINCE
       42  Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
       43  that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
       44  you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.
    SNOUT
       45  Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
    BOTTOM
       46  A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
       47  out moonshine, find out moonshine.
    QUINCE
       48  Yes, it doth shine that night.
    BOTTOM
       49  Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
       50  chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
       51  may shine in at the casement.
    QUINCE
       52  Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
       53  and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
       54  present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
       55  another thing: we must have a wall in the great
       56  chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
       57  talk through the chink of a wall.
    SNOUT
       58  You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
    BOTTOM
       59  Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
       60  have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
       61  about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
       62  fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
       63  and Thisby whisper.
    QUINCE
       64  If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
       65  every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
       66  Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
       67  speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
       68  according to his cue.
  Direction: Enter PUCK behind
    PUCK
       69  What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
       70  So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
       71  What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
       72  An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.
    QUINCE
       73  Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
    BOTTOM
       74  Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--
    QUINCE
       75  Odours, odours.
    BOTTOM
       76  --odours savours sweet:
       77  So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
       78  But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
       79  And by and by I will to thee appear.
  Direction: Exit
    PUCK
       80  A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
  Direction: Exit
    FLUTE
       81  Must I speak now?
    QUINCE
       82  Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
       83  but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
    FLUTE
       84  Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
       85  Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
       86  Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
       87  As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
       88  I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
    QUINCE
       89  'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
       90  yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
       91  part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
       92  is past; it is, 'never tire.'
    FLUTE
       93  O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
       94  never tire.
  Direction: Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head
    BOTTOM
       95  If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.
    QUINCE
       96  O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,
       97  masters! fly, masters! Help!
  Direction: Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
    PUCK
       98  I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
       99  Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
      100  Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
      101  A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
      102  And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
      103  Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
  Direction: Exit
    BOTTOM
      104  Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
      105  make me afeard.
  Direction: Re-enter SNOUT
    SNOUT
      106  O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?
    BOTTOM
      107  What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do
      108  you?
  Direction: Exit SNOUT
  Direction: Re-enter QUINCE
    QUINCE
      109  Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art
      110  translated.
  Direction: Exit
    BOTTOM
      111  I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
      112  to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
      113  from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
      114  and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
      115  I am not afraid.
  Direction: Sings
      116  The ousel cock so black of hue,
      117  With orange-tawny bill,
      118  The throstle with his note so true,
      119  The wren with little quill,--
    TITANIA
      120  [Awaking] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
    BOTTOM
      121  [Sings]
      122  The finch, the sparrow and the lark,
      123  The plain-song cuckoo gray,
      124  Whose note full many a man doth mark,
      125  And dares not answer nay;--
      126  for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish
      127  a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry
      128  'cuckoo' never so?
    TITANIA
      129  I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
      130  Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
      131  So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
      132  And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
      133  On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.
    BOTTOM
      134  Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
      135  for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
      136  love keep little company together now-a-days; the
      137  more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
      138  make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.
    TITANIA
      139  Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
    BOTTOM
      140  Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
      141  of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
    TITANIA
      142  Out of this wood do not desire to go:
      143  Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
      144  I am a spirit of no common rate;
      145  The summer still doth tend upon my state;
      146  And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
      147  I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
      148  And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
      149  And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
      150  And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
      151  That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
      152  Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
  Direction: Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED
    PEASEBLOSSOM
      153  Ready.
    COBWEB
      154  And I.
    MOTH
      155  And I.
    MUSTARDSEED
      156  And I.
    ALL
      157  Where shall we go?
    TITANIA
      158  Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
      159  Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
      160  Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
      161  With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
      162  The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
      163  And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
      164  And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
      165  To have my love to bed and to arise;
      166  And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
      167  To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
      168  Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
    PEASEBLOSSOM
      169  Hail, mortal!
    COBWEB
      170  Hail!
    MOTH
      171  Hail!
    MUSTARDSEED
      172  Hail!
    BOTTOM
      173  I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your
      174  worship's name.
    COBWEB
      175  Cobweb.
    BOTTOM
      176  I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
      177  Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with
      178  you. Your name, honest gentleman?
    PEASEBLOSSOM
      179  Peaseblossom.
    BOTTOM
      180  I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your
      181  mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good
      182  Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
      183  acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?
    MUSTARDSEED
      184  Mustardseed.
    BOTTOM
      185  Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:
      186  that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath
      187  devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
      188  you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
      189  desire your more acquaintance, good Master
      190  Mustardseed.
    TITANIA
      191  Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
      192  The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
      193  And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
      194  Lamenting some enforced chastity.
      195  Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.
  Direction: Exeunt
