          A Midsummer Night's Dream : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Another part of the wood.
  Direction: Enter TITANIA, with her train
    TITANIA
        1  Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
        2  Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
        3  Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
        4  Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
        5  To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
        6  The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
        7  At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
        8  Then to your offices and let me rest.
  Direction: The Fairies sing
        9  You spotted snakes with double tongue,
       10  Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
       11  Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
       12  Come not near our fairy queen.
       13  Philomel, with melody
       14  Sing in our sweet lullaby;
       15  Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
       16  Never harm,
       17  Nor spell nor charm,
       18  Come our lovely lady nigh;
       19  So, good night, with lullaby.
       20  Weaving spiders, come not here;
       21  Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
       22  Beetles black, approach not near;
       23  Worm nor snail, do no offence.
       24  Philomel, with melody
       25  Sing in our sweet lullaby.
       26  Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby.
       27  Never harm
       28  Nor spell nor charm
       29  Come our lovely lady nigh.
       30  So good night, with lullaby.
    Fairy
       31  Hence, away! now all is well:
       32  One aloof stand sentinel.
  Direction: Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps
  Direction: Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids
    OBERON
       33  What thou seest when thou dost wake,
       34  Do it for thy true-love take,
       35  Love and languish for his sake:
       36  Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
       37  Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
       38  In thy eye that shall appear
       39  When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
       40  Wake when some vile thing is near.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA
    LYSANDER
       41  Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
       42  And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
       43  We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
       44  And tarry for the comfort of the day.
    HERMIA
       45  Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
       46  For I upon this bank will rest my head.
    LYSANDER
       47  One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
       48  One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
    HERMIA
       49  Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
       50  Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
    LYSANDER
       51  O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
       52  Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
       53  I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
       54  So that but one heart we can make of it;
       55  Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
       56  So then two bosoms and a single troth.
       57  Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
       58  For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
    HERMIA
       59  Lysander riddles very prettily:
       60  Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
       61  If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
       62  But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
       63  Lie further off; in human modesty,
       64  Such separation as may well be said
       65  Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
       66  So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
       67  Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
    LYSANDER
       68  Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
       69  And then end life when I end loyalty!
       70  Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!
    HERMIA
       71  With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
  Direction: They sleep
  Direction: Enter PUCK
    PUCK
       72  Through the forest have I gone.
       73  But Athenian found I none,
       74  On whose eyes I might approve
       75  This flower's force in stirring love.
       76  Night and silence.--Who is here?
       77  Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
       78  This is he, my master said,
       79  Despised the Athenian maid;
       80  And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
       81  On the dank and dirty ground.
       82  Pretty soul! she durst not lie
       83  Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
       84  Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
       85  All the power this charm doth owe.
       86  When thou wakest, let love forbid
       87  Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
       88  So awake when I am gone;
       89  For I must now to Oberon.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running
    HELENA
       90  Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
    DEMETRIUS
       91  I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
    HELENA
       92  O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.
    DEMETRIUS
       93  Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
  Direction: Exit
    HELENA
       94  O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
       95  The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
       96  Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
       97  For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
       98  How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
       99  If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
      100  No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
      101  For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
      102  Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
      103  Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
      104  What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
      105  Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
      106  But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
      107  Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
      108  Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
    LYSANDER
      109  [Awaking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
      110  Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
      111  That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
      112  Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
      113  Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
    HELENA
      114  Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
      115  What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
      116  Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
    LYSANDER
      117  Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
      118  The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
      119  Not Hermia but Helena I love:
      120  Who will not change a raven for a dove?
      121  The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
      122  And reason says you are the worthier maid.
      123  Things growing are not ripe until their season
      124  So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
      125  And touching now the point of human skill,
      126  Reason becomes the marshal to my will
      127  And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
      128  Love's stories written in love's richest book.
    HELENA
      129  Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
      130  When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
      131  Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
      132  That I did never, no, nor never can,
      133  Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
      134  But you must flout my insufficiency?
      135  Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
      136  In such disdainful manner me to woo.
      137  But fare you well: perforce I must confess
      138  I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
      139  O, that a lady, of one man refused.
      140  Should of another therefore be abused!
  Direction: Exit
    LYSANDER
      141  She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
      142  And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
      143  For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
      144  The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
      145  Or as tie heresies that men do leave
      146  Are hated most of those they did deceive,
      147  So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
      148  Of all be hated, but the most of me!
      149  And, all my powers, address your love and might
      150  To honour Helen and to be her knight!
  Direction: Exit
    HERMIA
      151  [Awaking] Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best
      152  To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
      153  Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
      154  Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
      155  Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
      156  And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
      157  Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
      158  What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
      159  Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;
      160  Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
      161  No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
      162  Either death or you I'll find immediately.
  Direction: Exit
