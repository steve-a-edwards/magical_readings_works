          A Midsummer Night's Dream : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.
  Direction: Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and Attendants
    HIPPOLYTA
        1  'Tis strange my Theseus, that these
        2  lovers speak of.
    THESEUS
        3  More strange than true: I never may believe
        4  These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
        5  Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
        6  Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
        7  More than cool reason ever comprehends.
        8  The lunatic, the lover and the poet
        9  Are of imagination all compact:
       10  One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
       11  That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
       12  Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
       13  The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
       14  Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
       15  And as imagination bodies forth
       16  The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
       17  Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
       18  A local habitation and a name.
       19  Such tricks hath strong imagination,
       20  That if it would but apprehend some joy,
       21  It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
       22  Or in the night, imagining some fear,
       23  How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
    HIPPOLYTA
       24  But all the story of the night told over,
       25  And all their minds transfigured so together,
       26  More witnesseth than fancy's images
       27  And grows to something of great constancy;
       28  But, howsoever, strange and admirable.
    THESEUS
       29  Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
  Direction: Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA
       30  Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
       31  Accompany your hearts!
    LYSANDER
       32  More than to us
       33  Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
    THESEUS
       34  Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
       35  To wear away this long age of three hours
       36  Between our after-supper and bed-time?
       37  Where is our usual manager of mirth?
       38  What revels are in hand? Is there no play,
       39  To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
       40  Call Philostrate.
    PHILOSTRATE
       41  Here, mighty Theseus.
    THESEUS
       42  Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
       43  What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
       44  The lazy time, if not with some delight?
    PHILOSTRATE
       45  There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
       46  Make choice of which your highness will see first.
  Direction: Giving a paper
    THESEUS
       47  [Reads] 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
       48  By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
       49  We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
       50  In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
  Direction: Reads
       51  'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
       52  Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
       53  That is an old device; and it was play'd
       54  When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
  Direction: Reads
       55  'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
       56  Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
       57  That is some satire, keen and critical,
       58  Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
  Direction: Reads
       59  'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
       60  And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
       61  Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
       62  That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
       63  How shall we find the concord of this discord?
    PHILOSTRATE
       64  A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
       65  Which is as brief as I have known a play;
       66  But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
       67  Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
       68  There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
       69  And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
       70  For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
       71  Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
       72  Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
       73  The passion of loud laughter never shed.
    THESEUS
       74  What are they that do play it?
    PHILOSTRATE
       75  Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
       76  Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
       77  And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
       78  With this same play, against your nuptial.
    THESEUS
       79  And we will hear it.
    PHILOSTRATE
       80  No, my noble lord;
       81  It is not for you: I have heard it over,
       82  And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
       83  Unless you can find sport in their intents,
       84  Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
       85  To do you service.
    THESEUS
       86  I will hear that play;
       87  For never anything can be amiss,
       88  When simpleness and duty tender it.
       89  Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.
  Direction: Exit PHILOSTRATE
    HIPPOLYTA
       90  I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
       91  And duty in his service perishing.
    THESEUS
       92  Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
    HIPPOLYTA
       93  He says they can do nothing in this kind.
    THESEUS
       94  The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
       95  Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
       96  And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
       97  Takes it in might, not merit.
       98  Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
       99  To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
      100  Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
      101  Make periods in the midst of sentences,
      102  Throttle their practised accent in their fears
      103  And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
      104  Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
      105  Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
      106  And in the modesty of fearful duty
      107  I read as much as from the rattling tongue
      108  Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
      109  Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
      110  In least speak most, to my capacity.
  Direction: Re-enter PHILOSTRATE
    PHILOSTRATE
      111  So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.
    THESEUS
      112  Let him approach.
  Direction: Flourish of trumpets
  Direction: Enter QUINCE for the Prologue
    Prologue
      113  If we offend, it is with our good will.
      114  That you should think, we come not to offend,
      115  But with good will. To show our simple skill,
      116  That is the true beginning of our end.
      117  Consider then we come but in despite.
      118  We do not come as minding to contest you,
      119  Our true intent is. All for your delight
      120  We are not here. That you should here repent you,
      121  The actors are at hand and by their show
      122  You shall know all that you are like to know.
    THESEUS
      123  This fellow doth not stand upon points.
    LYSANDER
      124  He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
      125  not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
      126  enough to speak, but to speak true.
    HIPPOLYTA
      127  Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
      128  on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.
    THESEUS
      129  His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing
      130  impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
  Direction: Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion
    Prologue
      131  Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
      132  But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
      133  This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
      134  This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
      135  This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
      136  Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
      137  And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
      138  To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
      139  This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
      140  Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
      141  By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
      142  To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
      143  This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
      144  The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
      145  Did scare away, or rather did affright;
      146  And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
      147  Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
      148  Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
      149  And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
      150  Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
      151  He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
      152  And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
      153  His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
      154  Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
      155  At large discourse, while here they do remain.
  Direction: Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine
    THESEUS
      156  I wonder if the lion be to speak.
    DEMETRIUS
      157  No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
    Wall
      158  In this same interlude it doth befall
      159  That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
      160  And such a wall, as I would have you think,
      161  That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
      162  Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
      163  Did whisper often very secretly.
      164  This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
      165  That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
      166  And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
      167  Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
    THESEUS
      168  Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
    DEMETRIUS
      169  It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
      170  discourse, my lord.
  Direction: Enter Pyramus
    THESEUS
      171  Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!
    Pyramus
      172  O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
      173  O night, which ever art when day is not!
      174  O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
      175  I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
      176  And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
      177  That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
      178  Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
      179  Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
  Direction: Wall holds up his fingers
      180  Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
      181  But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
      182  O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
      183  Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
    THESEUS
      184  The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
    Pyramus
      185  No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
      186  is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
      187  spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
      188  fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
  Direction: Enter Thisbe
    Thisbe
      189  O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
      190  For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
      191  My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
      192  Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
    Pyramus
      193  I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
      194  To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!
    Thisbe
      195  My love thou art, my love I think.
    Pyramus
      196  Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
      197  And, like Limander, am I trusty still.
    Thisbe
      198  And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
    Pyramus
      199  Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
    Thisbe
      200  As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
    Pyramus
      201  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
    Thisbe
      202  I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
    Pyramus
      203  Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
    Thisbe
      204  'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.
  Direction: Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe
    Wall
      205  Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
      206  And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
  Direction: Exit
    THESEUS
      207  Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
    DEMETRIUS
      208  No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
      209  without warning.
    HIPPOLYTA
      210  This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
    THESEUS
      211  The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
      212  are no worse, if imagination amend them.
    HIPPOLYTA
      213  It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
    THESEUS
      214  If we imagine no worse of them than they of
      215  themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
      216  come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
  Direction: Enter Lion and Moonshine
    Lion
      217  You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
      218  The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
      219  May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
      220  When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
      221  Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
      222  A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;
      223  For, if I should as lion come in strife
      224  Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
    THESEUS
      225  A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
    DEMETRIUS
      226  The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
    LYSANDER
      227  This lion is a very fox for his valour.
    THESEUS
      228  True; and a goose for his discretion.
    DEMETRIUS
      229  Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
      230  discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
    THESEUS
      231  His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
      232  for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
      233  leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
    Moonshine
      234  This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--
    DEMETRIUS
      235  He should have worn the horns on his head.
    THESEUS
      236  He is no crescent, and his horns are
      237  invisible within the circumference.
    Moonshine
      238  This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
      239  Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
    THESEUS
      240  This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
      241  should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
      242  man i' the moon?
    DEMETRIUS
      243  He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
      244  see, it is already in snuff.
    HIPPOLYTA
      245  I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!
    THESEUS
      246  It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
      247  he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all
      248  reason, we must stay the time.
    LYSANDER
      249  Proceed, Moon.
    Moonshine
      250  All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
      251  lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this
      252  thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.
    DEMETRIUS
      253  Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
      254  these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.
  Direction: Enter Thisbe
    Thisbe
      255  This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
    Lion
      256  [Roaring] Oh--
  Direction: Thisbe runs off
    DEMETRIUS
      257  Well roared, Lion.
    THESEUS
      258  Well run, Thisbe.
    HIPPOLYTA
      259  Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
      260  good grace.
  Direction: The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit
    THESEUS
      261  Well moused, Lion.
    LYSANDER
      262  And so the lion vanished.
    DEMETRIUS
      263  And then came Pyramus.
  Direction: Enter Pyramus
    Pyramus
      264  Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
      265  I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
      266  For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
      267  I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
      268  But stay, O spite!
      269  But mark, poor knight,
      270  What dreadful dole is here!
      271  Eyes, do you see?
      272  How can it be?
      273  O dainty duck! O dear!
      274  Thy mantle good,
      275  What, stain'd with blood!
      276  Approach, ye Furies fell!
      277  O Fates, come, come,
      278  Cut thread and thrum;
      279  Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
    THESEUS
      280  This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
      281  go near to make a man look sad.
    HIPPOLYTA
      282  Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
    Pyramus
      283  O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
      284  Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
      285  Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
      286  That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
      287  with cheer.
      288  Come, tears, confound;
      289  Out, sword, and wound
      290  The pap of Pyramus;
      291  Ay, that left pap,
      292  Where heart doth hop:
  Direction: Stabs himself
      293  Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
      294  Now am I dead,
      295  Now am I fled;
      296  My soul is in the sky:
      297  Tongue, lose thy light;
      298  Moon take thy flight:
  Direction: Exit Moonshine
      299  Now die, die, die, die, die.
  Direction: Dies
    DEMETRIUS
      300  No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
    LYSANDER
      301  Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
    THESEUS
      302  With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
      303  prove an ass.
    HIPPOLYTA
      304  How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
      305  back and finds her lover?
    THESEUS
      306  She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
      307  her passion ends the play.
  Direction: Re-enter Thisbe
    HIPPOLYTA
      308  Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
      309  Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
    DEMETRIUS
      310  A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
      311  Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
      312  she for a woman, God bless us.
    LYSANDER
      313  She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
    DEMETRIUS
      314  And thus she means, videlicet:--
    Thisbe
      315  Asleep, my love?
      316  What, dead, my dove?
      317  O Pyramus, arise!
      318  Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
      319  Dead, dead? A tomb
      320  Must cover thy sweet eyes.
      321  These My lips,
      322  This cherry nose,
      323  These yellow cowslip cheeks,
      324  Are gone, are gone:
      325  Lovers, make moan:
      326  His eyes were green as leeks.
      327  O Sisters Three,
      328  Come, come to me,
      329  With hands as pale as milk;
      330  Lay them in gore,
      331  Since you have shore
      332  With shears his thread of silk.
      333  Tongue, not a word:
      334  Come, trusty sword;
      335  Come, blade, my breast imbrue:
  Direction: Stabs herself
      336  And, farewell, friends;
      337  Thus Thisby ends:
      338  Adieu, adieu, adieu.
  Direction: Dies
    THESEUS
      339  Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
    DEMETRIUS
      340  Ay, and Wall too.
    BOTTOM
      341  [Starting up] No assure you; the wall is down that
      342  parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
      343  epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
      344  of our company?
    THESEUS
      345  No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
      346  excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
      347  dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
      348  that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
      349  in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine
      350  tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
      351  discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
      352  epilogue alone.
  Direction: A dance
      353  The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
      354  Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
      355  I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
      356  As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
      357  This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
      358  The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
      359  A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
      360  In nightly revels and new jollity.
  Direction: Exeunt
  Direction: Enter PUCK
    PUCK
      361  Now the hungry lion roars,
      362  And the wolf behowls the moon;
      363  Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
      364  All with weary task fordone.
      365  Now the wasted brands do glow,
      366  Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
      367  Puts the wretch that lies in woe
      368  In remembrance of a shroud.
      369  Now it is the time of night
      370  That the graves all gaping wide,
      371  Every one lets forth his sprite,
      372  In the church-way paths to glide:
      373  And we fairies, that do run
      374  By the triple Hecate's team,
      375  From the presence of the sun,
      376  Following darkness like a dream,
      377  Now are frolic: not a mouse
      378  Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
      379  I am sent with broom before,
      380  To sweep the dust behind the door.
  Direction: Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train
    OBERON
      381  Through the house give gathering light,
      382  By the dead and drowsy fire:
      383  Every elf and fairy sprite
      384  Hop as light as bird from brier;
      385  And this ditty, after me,
      386  Sing, and dance it trippingly.
    TITANIA
      387  First, rehearse your song by rote
      388  To each word a warbling note:
      389  Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
      390  Will we sing, and bless this place.
  Direction: Song and dance
    OBERON
      391  Now, until the break of day,
      392  Through this house each fairy stray.
      393  To the best bride-bed will we,
      394  Which by us shall blessed be;
      395  And the issue there create
      396  Ever shall be fortunate.
      397  So shall all the couples three
      398  Ever true in loving be;
      399  And the blots of Nature's hand
      400  Shall not in their issue stand;
      401  Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
      402  Nor mark prodigious, such as are
      403  Despised in nativity,
      404  Shall upon their children be.
      405  With this field-dew consecrate,
      406  Every fairy take his gait;
      407  And each several chamber bless,
      408  Through this palace, with sweet peace;
      409  And the owner of it blest
      410  Ever shall in safety rest.
      411  Trip away; make no stay;
      412  Meet me all by break of day.
  Direction: Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train
    PUCK
      413  If we shadows have offended,
      414  Think but this, and all is mended,
      415  That you have but slumber'd here
      416  While these visions did appear.
      417  And this weak and idle theme,
      418  No more yielding but a dream,
      419  Gentles, do not reprehend:
      420  if you pardon, we will mend:
      421  And, as I am an honest Puck,
      422  If we have unearned luck
      423  Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
      424  We will make amends ere long;
      425  Else the Puck a liar call;
      426  So, good night unto you all.
      427  Give me your hands, if we be friends,
      428  And Robin shall restore amends.
