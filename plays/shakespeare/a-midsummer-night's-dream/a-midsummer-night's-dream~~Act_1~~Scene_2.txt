          A Midsummer Night's Dream : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.
  Direction: Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
    QUINCE
        1  Is all our company here?
    BOTTOM
        2  You were best to call them generally, man by man,
        3  according to the scrip.
    QUINCE
        4  Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
        5  thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
        6  interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
        7  wedding-day at night.
    BOTTOM
        8  First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
        9  on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
       10  to a point.
    QUINCE
       11  Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
       12  most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
    BOTTOM
       13  A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
       14  merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
       15  actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
    QUINCE
       16  Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
    BOTTOM
       17  Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
    QUINCE
       18  You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
    BOTTOM
       19  What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
    QUINCE
       20  A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
    BOTTOM
       21  That will ask some tears in the true performing of
       22  it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
       23  eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
       24  measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
       25  tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
       26  tear a cat in, to make all split.
       27  The raging rocks
       28  And shivering shocks
       29  Shall break the locks
       30  Of prison gates;
       31  And Phibbus' car
       32  Shall shine from far
       33  And make and mar
       34  The foolish Fates.
       35  This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
       36  This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
       37  more condoling.
    QUINCE
       38  Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
    FLUTE
       39  Here, Peter Quince.
    QUINCE
       40  Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
    FLUTE
       41  What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
    QUINCE
       42  It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
    FLUTE
       43  Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.
    QUINCE
       44  That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
       45  you may speak as small as you will.
    BOTTOM
       46  An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
       47  speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
       48  Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
       49  and lady dear!'
    QUINCE
       50  No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.
    BOTTOM
       51  Well, proceed.
    QUINCE
       52  Robin Starveling, the tailor.
    STARVELING
       53  Here, Peter Quince.
    QUINCE
       54  Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
       55  Tom Snout, the tinker.
    SNOUT
       56  Here, Peter Quince.
    QUINCE
       57  You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
       58  Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
       59  hope, here is a play fitted.
    SNUG
       60  Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
       61  be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
    QUINCE
       62  You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
    BOTTOM
       63  Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
       64  do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
       65  that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
       66  let him roar again.'
    QUINCE
       67  An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
       68  the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
       69  and that were enough to hang us all.
    ALL
       70  That would hang us, every mother's son.
    BOTTOM
       71  I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
       72  ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
       73  discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
       74  voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
       75  sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
       76  nightingale.
    QUINCE
       77  You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
       78  sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
       79  summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
       80  therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
    BOTTOM
       81  Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
       82  to play it in?
    QUINCE
       83  Why, what you will.
    BOTTOM
       84  I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
       85  beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
       86  beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
       87  perfect yellow.
    QUINCE
       88  Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
       89  then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
       90  are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
       91  you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
       92  and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
       93  town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
       94  we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
       95  company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
       96  will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
       97  wants. I pray you, fail me not.
    BOTTOM
       98  We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
       99  obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.
    QUINCE
      100  At the duke's oak we meet.
    BOTTOM
      101  Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.
  Direction: Exeunt
