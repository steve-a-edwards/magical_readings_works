          A Midsummer Night's Dream : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.
  Direction: Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING
    QUINCE
        1  Have you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come home yet?
    STARVELING
        2  He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
        3  transported.
    FLUTE
        4  If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes
        5  not forward, doth it?
    QUINCE
        6  It is not possible: you have not a man in all
        7  Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
    FLUTE
        8  No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
        9  man in Athens.
    QUINCE
       10  Yea and the best person too; and he is a very
       11  paramour for a sweet voice.
    FLUTE
       12  You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,
       13  a thing of naught.
  Direction: Enter SNUG
    SNUG
       14  Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and
       15  there is two or three lords and ladies more married:
       16  if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made
       17  men.
    FLUTE
       18  O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
       19  day during his life; he could not have 'scaped
       20  sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
       21  sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;
       22  he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
       23  Pyramus, or nothing.
  Direction: Enter BOTTOM
    BOTTOM
       24  Where are these lads? where are these hearts?
    QUINCE
       25  Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
    BOTTOM
       26  Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
       27  what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
       28  will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.
    QUINCE
       29  Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
    BOTTOM
       30  Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that
       31  the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
       32  good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
       33  pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look
       34  o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our
       35  play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have
       36  clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion
       37  pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the
       38  lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions
       39  nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
       40  do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
       41  comedy. No more words: away! go, away!
  Direction: Exeunt
